after entering the new century , economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge facing african countries .
the leaders of african countries have come to realize more and more clearly that africa can no longer miss good opportunities and should work hard to seek countermeasures .
on july 9 , 2002 , the african union was officially established and started operation . since then , african countries have actively pursued a " new partnership for african development " program , striven to shake off the unfavorable situation of economic globalization as soon as possible , while on the other hand making great efforts to resolve the armed conflict that is the major obstacle to the great cause of african rejuvenation , so as to create a united , peaceful , and stable environment .
at present , the overall situation in africa has become more relaxed , hot issues have noticeably dropped , and various countries have enhanced their sense of urgency to end armed conflicts .
with the strong support of the united nations and the international community , the influential regional organizations , regional powers , and well - known politicians in africa have all taken active actions , intensifying their efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate internal turmoil , and basically controlling conflicts and turbulence that have lasted for many years .
for instance , the congolese government was set up in june last year , the government of sao tome and principe was peacefully settling the coup crisis , the liberia government and rebel forces signed a peace accord in august , the sudanese government and the south anti - government forces began their crucial talks in september , the armed forces and political factions in somali started their peace talks in kenya in october , the peace process across the country , and the peace agreement with the burundi government .
of course , at present , the situation of stability in the african region is still rather fragile , and peace has yet to be consolidated , while some potential or practical armed conflicts still need to be finally resolved .
at the same time , there is still a big gap between the economic growth of african countries and the developing countries in asia , and these are all unfavorable factors for africa 's development .
how the african countries can effectively deal with the challenge of economic globalization and realize the dream of african rejuvenation still requires long - term and arduous efforts by the african people .

about 60 percent of them died from new town .
he said that no immediate killing had been ordered .
the indonesian state news agency quoted sudaraga 's statement as saying that authorities had made use of britain and australia to test the virus strain , but the test results might not be available until wednesday or thursday , but the government would submit a report to relevant international organizations .

both taiwan and japan are democratic countries and have the obligation and responsibility to work together to consolidate asian democracy .
in order to promote the value of democracy , the chinese government will establish a " taiwan democratic foundation " in the near future . international political party cooperation is one of the key tasks .
the democratic progressive party hopes to use this opportunity to work hand in hand with democratic parties in other countries to share the experience of democratic development with other countries , make contributions to peace , stability and prosperity in asia , and realize the ideal of the " asian democratic alliance " at an early date .
today , when the international situation is rapidly changing , forces in the region are growing all - round , and the security of all countries is being tested .
as far as the asia - pacific region is concerned , since the us war on iraq last month , north korea , which has been heavily in possession of nuclear weapons , has test - fired missiles many times over japan 's airspace , and china has already vigorously expanded its armaments to target taiwan with ballistic missiles .
all this has constituted a serious threat to the security of taiwan and japan and the asia - pacific region .
these issues related to democratic consolidation and security protection need a formal security mechanism to be discussed and resolved .
today 's meeting is the democratic progressive party , the ruling liberal democratic party , and the liberal democratic party and members of other political parties in taiwan . the importance of this is self-evident .
i also hope that apart from the bilateral dialogues between taiwan and japan , in the future the neighboring countries of the united states , japan , and the rok will cooperate to promote the establishment of a " security dialogue mechanism , " and also support taiwan to participate in regional multiborder dialogue organizations in order to implement the spirit of " cooperative security . "
today is an important moment that will encourage us to continue to advance along the road of reform , and we give the greatest affirmation to all comrades in the party who can embody the will of our party and work together to achieve the goal of reform .
" the withdrawal of political parties from the radio , film and television media " is the most basic requirement for carrying out the media reform . it is also the ideal that the dpp has always adhered to . its rule will only speed up the pace of reform , not obstruct or burden .
we also know that to promote this goal , it is a small step in the media reform to let public comrades in the party take the lead in quitting media operations .
in the past period when the media was in a state of emergency , many comrades in the party , in order to strive for the space of public opinion , successively set up the fourth station and local radio stations with arduous tasks , hoping that by doing so , they could break through existing restrictions and increase their ability to promote the transformation of the media environment .
for example , comrade cai tongrong had put in a lot of painstaking effort for the birth of the fourth wireless television station in the past and finally had the birth of " civil eyes . "
this will have a considerable impact on the entire media environment , especially in breaking through the long - term monopoly of the three stations , and will create more space for cable tv stations to advance their operations .
however , we must understand that due to the limitations of the historical environment and because there are many things that cannot be done in the course of pushing reform , the space of the media is now completely open and free , representing the task of the current stage has been fulfilled , and we are bound to sacrifice ourselves in order to continue the reform process .
the standing committee of the kmt central committee declared that all public comrades in the party would withdraw from the media and set an example in order to honor their commitment to the people before 5 september .
we are very gratified that the comrades who regard the party 's ideals and goals as their remembrance , including cai tongrong , chang chun - hung , zhou qingyu , hou shusheng , gao mengding , huang naive , and shen ming - kung , who have made more contributions in the democratic movement , can give up the smaller ones and give priority to the media reform .
ruling the country is not the enjoyment of power , but the increase of responsibilities .
in the course of ruling , the dpp is always able to meet or meet with setbacks and swells . we are always capable of challenges as our way of advance and are firmly leading taiwan in building a democratic and in - depth project . at the same time , we can link with the world 's democratic , peaceful , and prosperous universal values .
this is because we have always believed that the people are the masters of this country . the responsibility of the dpp is to upgrade the pioneering spirit of " being honest , diligent , and loving native land " to a bright prospect of " reform , progress , and good life " and lay the foundation for the long - term peace and stability of the 23 million taiwan people .
for a long time , the dpp played the role of " separation between government " and created brilliant achievements in developing taiwan 's diplomacy .
despite the continuous suppression of the chinese communists , we have never retreated because our destiny is in our own hands . even without rich resources , the dpp is still taking a step forward and expanding its international participation space for taiwan .
" pluralism " is the main axis of the democratic progressive party 's overall foreign policy strategy . in the past year , we have successfully shared experiences and exchanged political parties with countries in the region on the basis of the " asian free and democratic union . "
in march next year , i will officially take over as chairman of the " asian freedom and democracy union " in the hope that i can create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community in my capacity as leader of international organizations .
in addition , since the dpp became a formal member of the " international freedom alliance " last year , it has also actively participated in related matters .
in addition to sending personnel to the secretariat of the london headquarters as the commissioner for human rights , it will also cooperate with other members ' political parties to hold seminars on political reform in central and south america and in europe .
on september 28 , our party celebrated its 17 th birthday .
the 17 - year - old democratic progressive party always adhered to the ideal of democracy and was full of strength for reform and progress .
it is precisely because we have always stood on the side of democratic reform that we can win the trust of the taiwan people . it is precisely because of this that the responsibility and mission we are shouldering in the future are even more serious and important .
when we assumed the position as the ruling party three years ago , the previous ruling party made a roundabout trip to another round of six constitutional amendments in the 1990s .
the entire process of amending the national assembly in 1991 , handling direct election of the president in 1994 , freezing provincial government organizations in 1997 , and setting up the national congress in 2000 will be very constitutional . in fact , the tracks of the taiwan people 's intensification of sovereignty and democracy and justice are all around .
if we take the presidential directly elected taiwan in 1996 as the most important symbol of a democratic country with independent sovereignty , then by 2006 , this " complete " country is now 10 years old .
after 10 years of practice , we must think that as a democratic country with independent sovereignty , what will we pursue next ?
i must say that in the next stage , we should further pursue the deepening of democracy and a more efficient constitutional system in order to lead the taiwan people in accepting the stern challenges of the new century .
asia is the largest continent in the world . it accounts for nearly 30 percent of the world 's land area . its population accounts for about 60 percent of the world 's total population and one fourth of the world 's total . it should and can make outstanding contributions to world peace and development .
asia has a long splendid culture . the huang he and chang jiang valley , the indian and henghe basins , the euphrates river , and the basins are famous human civilizations .
in the long historical process , the people of asia have written a brilliant chapter in the development of human civilization .
in modern times , asia has experienced many vicissitudes and suffered repeated tribulations . the peoples of all countries have made unremitting efforts to strive for liberation and to seek development and have made tremendous achievements .
however , there is still a long way to go before asia can emerge and become prosperous .
strengthening cooperation , promoting development , and achieving a win - win situation is the only way for the rise and rejuvenation of asia , and is also where the fundamental interests of the asian people lie .
in the new century and new situation , asia is facing new opportunities for development .
peace and development are still the main theme of the present era and the overall peaceful international environment provide favorable external conditions for the development of asia .
the in - depth development of economic globalization , the rapid development of scientific and technological revolution in the world , and the accelerated reorganization and transfer of production elements in the international community are beneficial to asian countries in making use of international capital , importing advanced technology , opening up the international market , and promoting their own economic development .
asia is rich in resources and has a vast market , which is the most dynamic region in the world today , and its development potential is enormous .
china has a large population and an underdeveloped population . this is china 's two major national conditions .
china has a population of 1.3 billion . no matter how small it is , if it takes 1.3 billion , it will become a very big problem . no matter how considerable financial and material resources are , it will be very low per capita .
this is something that chinese leaders must keep in mind at any time .
we cannot rely on others to solve the problems of 1.3 billion people , and we can only rely on ourselves .
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , great achievements have been made in our construction , but we have also taken some detours and lost some opportunities .
since the beginning of reform and opening up in 1978 , we have finally found a correct road for developing ourselves .
this is : the chinese people will independently build socialism with chinese characteristics .
the quintessence of this road is to bring all positive factors into play , liberate and develop the productive forces , and respect and guarantee the freedom of the chinese people to pursue happiness .
china 's reform and opening up , from rural to urban areas , and from economic to political , cultural , and social spheres .
in the final analysis , every step it makes is for the purpose of giving free rein to the vitality of all labor , knowledge , technology , management , and capital so that all sources for creating social wealth will flow into full play .
in recent years , profound changes have taken place in the world , science and technology are changing with each passing day , the level of the world 's productive forces is constantly improving , and the world market is getting closer and closer , creating a historical opportunity for the development of various countries .
however , what merits our attention is that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , infectious diseases , and environmental deterioration are still threatening world stability and development .
the negative impact of economic globalization has increased the risks and costs of developing countries ' economic and social development , and some developing countries are even facing the danger of being marginalized .
at present , although the world economy is gradually recovering , there are still many uncertain factors .
the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations has suffered setbacks , and trade protectionism and other complicated factors have increased the difficulties of developing countries .
what is gratifying is that the vast numbers of developing countries are vigorously forging ahead , carrying out reform , and going all out to make the country prosperous and have attained spectacular achievements .
on the international stage , relying on the non-aligned movement and the 77 - nation bloc , developing countries have strengthened unity and cooperation , made important contributions to safeguarding their own legitimate rights and interests and changing the irrational international political and economic order , and become an important force in promoting the democratization of international relations .
at the same time , the exchanges and cooperation between the developing countries have also produced fruitful results and the economic exchanges between them have become even more frequent .
from the andes mountain range to the mekong river , from the meagre union to the establishment of the african union , south - south cooperation has been constantly enriched , perfected , and updated in terms of content , form , and mechanism .
the past year is also a year for the continuous development of sino - canadian friendly and cooperative relations in all fields .
trade between the two countries has maintained a growth momentum , with a total trade volume of nearly $ 10 billion .
the frequent high - level contacts between the canadian foreign minister , defense minister , environment minister , and other important political figures have visited china one after another . high - level officials , including the president of china 's supreme court and the minister of commerce , have also visited canada one after another . more importantly , the prime ministers of the two countries have successfully exchanged visits .
premier wen jiabao 's recent visit to canada is of significance for carrying on from the past and forging ahead into the future , injecting new vitality into the further development of sino - canadian relations , and laying a solid foundation for the continuous development of friendly cooperation in various fields between the two countries .
china and canada will continue to strengthen cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields , and strive to achieve the goal of quadrupling the total volume of bilateral trade by 2010 .
overseas chinese , friends .
although you live overseas , you have always been concerned about the development of the motherland and are always concerned about the worries of the people of the motherland , play the part of the people of the motherland , and beat the pulse of the motherland at every crucial moment .
after being attacked by sars and floods in some areas of china last year , you expressed deep concern and blessings to the people of the motherland through such means as network , correspondence , telephone , and donations , and chinese people from all walks of life have held a series of large - scale fundraising and voluntary performances many times , and when " shenzhou - 5 " manned spaceflight is a complete success , your congratulatory messages , congratulation letters , and greeting cards have become very proud of china 's achievements
during premier wen jiabao 's visit to canada , hundreds of overseas chinese and chinese students went to the airport and capitol hill to welcome premier wen 's visit , and many moving scenes emerged .
i would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone , and i believe that you will continue to make greater contributions to china 's prosperity and strength , to the development of sino - canadian relations , and to china 's complete reunification and comprehensive rejuvenation in the new year .
first , strengthen political mutual trust and deepen strategic cooperation .
as permanent members of the un security council , china and france are both countries with important influence on international affairs .
we two countries agree to promote world multipolarization , advocate safeguarding the authority of the united nations , and are willing to promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order in line with the wishes of the people of all countries .
our two countries share extensive consensus and common interests in dealing with various challenges facing mankind and in properly handling major international affairs .
we are willing to strengthen dialogue and consultation with france on such major issues as fighting terrorism , preventing proliferation , cracking down on transnational crime , promoting common development , and strengthening the role of the united nations , conduct close cooperation , and work hard to safeguard world peace and promote common development .
second , it is necessary to strengthen economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutual complementarity .
china is the largest developing country in the world , and is making all - out efforts to carry out modernization and has a vast market .
france is a developed country , with its economic and scientific and technological levels in the forefront of the world , and possesses leading technologies in many fields .
the economies of our two countries are highly complementary , and there is enormous potential for economic and trade cooperation .
since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always attached great importance to developing relations with africa and formulated a series of principles and policies .
we have always adhered to the five principles of peaceful coexistence , respected african countries in choosing their own political system and road of development , provided aid to african countries within our capacity , carried out economic and technological cooperation , supported african countries in unity and cooperation , promoted african peace and development , supported african countries in international affairs on an equal footing , strengthened consultation and cooperation between china and africa , and jointly safeguarded the rights and interests of developing countries .
sino - african friendship goes back to ancient times and has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people .
since the founding of new china , we have always firmly supported the cause of national liberation in africa and sincerely assisted african countries in developing their national economy .
chinese experts , doctors , teachers , and workers sent to africa shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with the local people , work in a friendly manner , live in harmony with each other , and have affection for each other .
in international affairs , china and african countries understand and support each other and become mutually trusted partners .
the chinese people will never forget that at the 26th un general assembly in 1971 , precisely with the energetic support of the developing countries , including african countries , china smoothly restored its legitimate seat in the united nations .
in recent years , mutual political trust between chinese and african people at all levels and in all fields has been constantly deepened , economic and trade cooperation has been fruitful , friendly exchanges in cultural , educational , public health , science and technology , and sports have been developing vigorously , and the china - africa cooperation forum , established at the beginning of the century , has set up a new platform for developing sino - african relations and deepening cooperation .
china and africa have decided to establish a new partnership of long - term stability , equality , and mutual benefit . sino - african friendship and cooperation have entered a new stage of comprehensive development .
seven years after nixon visited china and the shanghai communique , the carter administration accepted china 's stance on the taiwan issue and realized sino - us diplomatic relations .
this incident and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states have opened a new chapter in sino - us relations .
in the early days of reagan 's administration , there was a fierce confrontation between china and the united states on the taiwan issue .
through arduous negotiations , in 1982 , the two governments issued the famous " 17 august " communique and reached an agreement on gradually resolving the issue of arms sales to taiwan .
the shanghai communique , the sino - us joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations , and the " august 17 " communiqu jointly constitute the political cornerstone of sino - us relations .
in the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the united states , although the two countries have had struggle on the taiwan issue and other issues , on the whole sino - us relations have been stable and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have increased with each passing day .
in the 1980 's and early 1990 's , drastic changes took place in eastern europe , the breakup of the soviet union , and the end of the cold war . the most profound changes have taken place in the international situation since world war ii .
the united states has taken the lead in imposing sanctions on china , announcing its decision on selling 150 - 16 fighters to taiwan , linking the human rights issue with most - favored - nation status , and allowing lee teng - hui to visit the united states , with the result that sino - us relations have fallen into the low ebb .
with the rapid development of china 's economy , china 's international status has been constantly enhanced .
more and more people in the united states have come to realize that the improvement and development of sino - us relations conforms to the interests of the united states and china .
half a year ago , in this hall , we successfully launched the six - party talks process and established the direction of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue .
over the past six months , all sides have carried out continuous dialogue and consultations , made a lot of and in - depth preparations for holding a new round of talks , and enhanced understanding of each other 's stance through this process .
at present , all parties are looking forward to the concrete results of the second round of talks , agreeing to resolve their concerns through coordinated and consistent steps , and hoping that the peace process opened up by the six - party talks will continue .
these constitute an important foundation for our talks today .
the important significance of the second round of talks is to start discussions on substantive issues , which marks another step forward in the peace talks .
this round of talks will focus on establishing specific goals for resolving the nuclear issue , exploring first - stage measures for resolving the nuclear issue , and studying ways of continuing the talks .
as the talks proceed in depth , we will still deal with more difficulties and meet more challenges . however , this is the duty entrusted us by history and also the international community has placed their hopes on us .
our six - party meeting here represents the strong political desire of the governments and peoples of the six countries to seek peace .
our talks are for the purpose of expanding consensus , not highlighting differences , and for the purpose of resolving problems , not sharpening contradictions .
the chinese side believes that all sides are able to realize the peaceful mission on their shoulders , show mutual respect , flexibility , and narrow their differences with a constructive attitude , cooperation , and understanding .
the second round of six - party talks in beijing finished on the agenda after more than three days of negotiations .
i would like to express my gratitude to the leaders , representatives and working personnel of various countries for their contributions .
if the first round of talks set the major goal of denuclearizing the peninsula , then the significance of the current round of talks lies in the substantial dialogue and a new step toward realizing the goal .
during the talks , all the parties carried out in - depth and constructive discussions , discussed ways and steps for resolving problems in a wise and rational way , put forward valuable ideas , and made positive policy declarations .
the talks have achieved a series of useful results . in particular , the reaching of consensus on the next round of talks and the setting up of working groups is of great significance to advancing the peace talks process .
dear colleagues , peace and development are the theme of our great era .
the people of the six countries who represent you need peace , desire peace and love peace , and the people of all countries in the world need peace , desire peace and love peace .
over the past three days , the international community has been following beijing closely , watching the diaoyutai state , and pinning high hopes on this round of talks .
some people may think that the results of the talks are not enough and the process is not quick enough .
my view is that the current round of talks started when the parties concerned lack mutual trust and the gap in their positions is widening .
the chinese government 's stand on the taiwan issue has been consistent , that is , adhering to the basic principle of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems . "
to this end , we have done our best , displayed the greatest sincerity , and done a lot of work .
however , our efforts have met with provocation from the taiwan authorities and the " taiwan independence " forces .
we respect the democratic demands of the taiwan people , but we oppose the taiwan authorities and " taiwan independence " forces engaging in " taiwan independence " activities in the name of democracy and separating taiwan from the motherland .
the reason why we clearly state our determination and will to safeguard the motherland 's reunification is to safeguard peace and stability in the taiwan strait region .
we have said that so long as there is a thread of hope , we will do our best to realize the reunification of the motherland in a peaceful way .
we appreciate president bush 's reiteration of the one - china stand and send a clear signal to the " taiwan independence " forces .
the leader of the taiwan authorities claimed that " in order to prevent china from encroaching on taiwan by force and unilaterally changing the status quo across the strait , we must promote a peaceful referendum on the 23 rd . "
this is slandering the mainland 's efforts for peace and is also a provocation to cross - strait relations .
at present , the real threat to taiwan 's security does not come from the mainland , but from the taiwan authorities ' vigorous " taiwan independence " separatist activities .
the " taiwan independence " separatist force is the direct source of undermining the status quo of cross - strait relations and jeopardizing cross - strait peace .
the taiwan authorities distort the mainland 's opposition to " taiwan independence " separation and the maintenance of stability in the taiwan strait as a means to suppress taiwan 's democracy and freedom and use this as an excuse to hold a referendum .
this is groundless , confusing right and wrong , and is aimed at winning sympathy and support for him in continuing to pursue the splittist line .
the leader of the taiwan authorities has claimed to hold a so - called " referendum on defense " and " a referendum on peace , " but no matter how he package , this provocative act will only provoke antagonism and hostility between the two sides of the strait , aggravate cross - strait tension , and push cross - strait relations to the brink of danger step by step .
this completely runs counter to the mainstream public opinion of the taiwan compatriots in seeking peace , stability , and development , and is not the deepening of taiwan 's " democracy , " but is misleading and manipulating the taiwan people and a serious threat to peace and stability in the asia - pacific region and is bound to be opposed by the compatriots on both sides and the international community .
taking a general look at the historical process of the development of the chinese nation , reunification has always been the mainstream , the trend of the times , and the desire of the people .
with the motherland becoming stronger and stronger , cross - strait cooperation has been constantly strengthened , the international community has generally recognized the pattern of one china more consolidated , and all splittist schemes are doomed to failure .
another two weeks or so is the lunar new year , which is also one of the traditional festivals that chinese attach great importance to .
on this happy day , we are accustomed to gathering and exchanging gifts with our loved ones .
in the spirit of " linking people , delivering business " , hongkong post collaborates with china post to launch the " mainland - hong kong gift fulfilment service " to send their hearts and wishes to their relatives and friends in the mainland or hong kong during the spring festival .
hongkong post has been working with other postal administrations to provide international fulfilment service .
as early as december 2002 , australia post introduced the wine and wine logistics service for hong kong people .
this time we are working with china post to extend the already close co - operation between the two sides on postal services , postal remittance and courierpost services to cross - boundary logistics services to meet the increasing demand of hong kong people sending gifts to their relatives , friends or customers in the mainland .
the first batch of gift sets consists of exquisite lunar new year gift sets packed with candles , tea leaves and dried seafood , etc.
the gift sets are very respectable to friends and relatives on the mainland and business partners .
over the past three decades , the consumer council has made significant contributions to consumer protection .
it is best to assess the effectiveness of consumer council 's work , as to whether consumer rights have been substantially improved .
i agree with mr chan 's remarks that after 30 years , not only the consumers are aware of their own interests , but the community has also attached importance to consumers ' rights , which is the fruit of the efforts of the consumer council and the government .
the council conducts regular tests on the products , conducts market surveys and studies on the operation of different products and services , and releases fair and objective market information to the public through the " choice " magazine .
the " choice " magazine was deeply trusted by citizens , and now the " choice " magazine has been developing a website , which will more effectively give play to its function and help consumers obtain market information more conveniently .
the council has 11 district consumer advisory centres and 16 telephone hotlines to provide consumer information on goods and services and receive consumer complaints .
since its establishment , the number of enquiries received by the consumer council has increased from several thousand cases in the early 1970 s to 146,000 cases last year , an increase of more than 20 times , indicating that more and more consumers will make reference to the consumer council 's report and views before choosing products and services .
in addition , the cc handled more than 26,000 complaints this year .
the consumer council will also name individual shops with unscrupulous practices , which not only help consumers to beware of swindlers but also serve as a deterrent to operators .
i told you at the time of 7 : 00 , i had watched the television very carefully before i made a lot of reflections on the community 's aspirations and resentment and dissatisfaction with the government 's administration .
in this regard , the government and i have been making great efforts to improve the situation over the past six to seven months . seeing that the public 's demand is to address the economic and livelihood problems , we have made a lot of efforts in this regard and we are aware that there are a lot of public views on article 23 of the basic law .
i have a clear understanding of the community 's aspirations for democracy .
however , i would like to tell you that what i am doing today is to ensure that everything will proceed smoothly after the constitutional review starts , so that some basic issues will be resolved first .
what is the basic question ?
some are questions of principle , some are questions of law , which involve constitutional review of the basic law , and how we should understand these provisions first .
we are working on this part and a three - member team has started to do this .
it will consult the central authorities and listen to your views in hong kong , and i think this is a very good step and a decision we take seriously the views of the hong kong community .
in today 's highly competitive business environment , brand name plays a key role in the success of our products .
in order to create a brand name , it is not something that can be done overnight . it is necessary to have creative design , excellent quality , heartening , effective marketing , and sustained investment .
hong kong has the right to create a brand name .
we have relevant knowledge , skills and experiences , from design , manufacturing , marketing to management , and we have a vast market .
cta , which has just started implementing , will increase our advantages . in addition to the zero tariff preference for entering the mainland market , its greatest advantage is to encourage businessmen to use their brains to increase the added value of their products so that they will become famous brands that hong kong , the mainland , and even the world consumers love .
the " top ten brand hong kong election " held by the chinese manufacturers ' association coincided with the cta 's move to advance hong kong products toward high value added direction .
in the past five years , this election has given birth to 51 " top ten hong kong brands . "
however , in the face of this huge market in the mainland , the 51 brands are really not what we need . we need hundreds and thousands of names , more of them are " hong kong name brands " .
over the years , the hong kong subway has been actively involved in the mass transit railway ( mtr ) projects in major cities in the mainland , bringing their rich experience in hong kong into the mainland market through service .
i am pleased that the quality of hong kong 's investment , professional services and managerial staff has been affirmed by the mainland market .
such exchanges between hong kong and shenzhen will not only contribute to the development of the mainland , but also create more opportunities for hong kong businessmen and create more jobs for hong kong in the economic arena .
i would like to thank the central government and the shenzhen special economic zone government for their support in terms of policies .
it is indeed gratifying that the hong kong people and compatriots in the mainland are taking part in the development of china 's subway system for the first time .
i wish you all the best to obtain formal approval from the central government for the construction of shenzhen 's track transportation line 4 , which will lay a more strong foundation for future exchanges and cooperation between hong kong and shenzhen .
on the fifth day of the lunar new year , i am delighted to have been invited by the trade fair to attend your spring festival greetings and to officiate at the opening ceremony of the new year 's golden market .
first of all , i wish you a happy new year , a year of the monkey , a good time , and a prosperous flow .
the sharp rise in gold prices in the past year has further broken through the $ 400 - dollar barrier , which has continued to be strong , reflecting investors ' confidence in gold .
i believe the business sector has been very busy in the past year .
as a matter of fact , the smooth running of the market not only affected by external factors , but also reflected the achievements of the trading market over the past 90 years .
these efforts not only laid the foundation for hong kong 's gold market , but also contributed greatly to the consolidation of hong kong 's status as an international financial centre .
as to the so - called " spring is the one - year plan , " i hope that the industry will continue to work hard in the coming year , get a good grasp of the " golden " time of the gold industry , grasp the reform of the mainland 's gold market , china 's wto entry , and even cta , and continue to promote the development of the market .
i believe that with the active promotion of the industry , hong kong 's gold market will certainly be replete in the coming year .
finally , i wish the golden year of the monkey a prosperous and thriving business .
thank you .
however , the past challenge is not limited to subsidised public housing , but also to the private sector .
in the wake of the outbreak of the financial crisis in 1997 , the collapse of the bubble assets caused a great drop in property prices by 70% , which was a major factor that intensified deflation over the past five years .
we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure sustained and steady development of the property market .
a healthy property market is crucial to hong kong 's continued economic recovery .
we are also committed to protecting and improving our living environment .
our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development , with better urban design , better conservation of the natural landscape and heritage in hong kong and better living environment .
we will pay more attention to the overall environment .
the lessons of the sars outbreak in hong kong last year reminded us of the need to strive to create a more spacious , clean and hygienic living environment .
we have stepped up beautification of the environment , planting more trees , building more parks and recreational facilities for the enjoyment of the public .
i would like to thank members for their views on the judiciary , law , political system , civil service and the security aspects of the chief executive 's policy address .
the honourable margaret ng and hon tsang yok - sing are the chairmen and deputy chairmen of the panel on administration of justice and legal services of the legislative council .
the chief executive has put forward a number of measures in his policy address to promote civil and government policies , including strengthening the ties between principal officials and the community , conducting more public policy studies , strengthening the cooperation between the government and the legislative council , and seriously carrying out constitutional review .
the department of justice is fully committed to ensuring that all the measures taken by the government are in compliance with the law and procedures , particularly with the basic law , including the basic rights and freedoms protected by the community , and at the same time , will maintain vigilance as the hon margaret ng has said to safeguard the rule of law and judicial independence in hong kong .
as a principal official , i will certainly try my best to understand the views of the community and the legal profession on issues affecting judicial affairs and the legal profession .
for example , the mainland and hong kong closer economic partnership arrangement ( cepa ) is the result of close co - operation between the government and the industry , including the bar association , the law society , and the china council of trustees of witnesses .
we have successfully included " legal services " in cepa as one of the mainland 's open service sectors , which will provide a new platform for strengthening cooperation in legal services between the two places and bring about both macroeconomic and long - term benefits to the legal services of the two places .
the task force is two - way and we will reflect to the central authorities the work of listening to public opinion in hong kong .
since mid - january this year , we have received more than 10 organisations and individuals .
all of us fully accept that hong kong 's political development needs to comply with " one country , two systems , " and that the hong kong sar is directly under the central government .
most of them consider that hong kong 's political system needs to be improved , but they also accept that any development must be in line with the basic law .
organisations and individuals also have their views on individual procedures and legal issues .
the task force will fully transfer their views and comments to the central authorities .
in the coming month or so , the task force will continue to meet with other organisations and individuals , and we will continue to convey our views to the central authorities .
this is only the first meeting between the task force and the relevant departments of the central authorities , and we will need to continue with the central authorities in future .
i am sure you all understand that constitutional development concerns the relationship between the central authorities and the hksar and that the central authorities have the constitutional power and responsibility to oversee the constitutional development of the hksar , and we need to discuss with the central authorities fully .
the west kowloon cultural district ( wkcd ) has never been a major arts and cultural project in hong kong , not only for the provision of cultural and entertainment space for the community , but also for the enhancement of the quality of the community and the city .
the construction of the west kowloon cultural district is a community in hong kong .
the government must continue to explore in depth with various sectors of the community and draw on collective wisdom .
we understand that we must not only pursue the beauty of buildings but also ensure that they are economically efficient and sustainable and can improve the quality of life of our citizens .
the government therefore attaches great importance to the software completeness of the west kowloon cultural district ( wkcd ) . it must have relevant measures in place , including the management policy of the facilities , the promotion strategy of the arts programmes , the content of the performances and the promotion strategy .
the formulation of these relevant strategies must listen carefully to the opinions of " users . "
one of the most important players in the future west kowloon cultural district ( wkcd ) is the youth friend you are sitting .
we hope that the region will be able to retain a good mix of young and old alike , whether hong kong people or overseas tourists , whether mature or vibrant young people .
i understand that you had discussed the various aspects of the wkcd project this morning and some students have spent a lot of hard work in the past month and i believe you are very familiar with the details of the project .
i am anxious to listen to your discussions and to exchange views with you .
since the september 11 terrorist attack , global attention has been focused on port , airport and border security .
as the largest port in the world to export containers to the united states , hong kong undoubtedly responded rapidly to the us " port security initiative . "
in addition , we believe that cutting the lifeline of terrorist organisations is also an effective means to contain terrorist activities .
the huge amount of funds flowing out of the global financial system has been vexed by the criminal proceeds and the money laundering law enforcement agencies .
as a major financial centre in asia , we believe that cutting off the funds of terrorists may be the most effective way to fundamentally crack down on their structure .
at present , hong kong 's legislature is discussing various improvement measures to tighten existing legislation against terrorist financing and to actively respond to international standards and situations such as the new recommendations of the financial action task force on money laundering .
in addition , we are seeking to introduce better information disclosure legislation to facilitate the reporting of suspicious transactions by the relevant organizations and individuals .
" balance " is also the key to this work : effective investigation power , constitutional protection , personal privacy , economic and financial efficiency must all be taken into account .
our control measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , fairness and efficiency .
as a matter of fact , hong kong 's service sector has the advantage in many ways .
hong kong 's professional and business services personnel have a deep understanding of international and mainland business operations .
the professional services such as accounting , finance , law and arbitration in hong kong are the best partners in the process of mainland enterprises moving toward internationalization and linking with the world market .
our transportation , construction , design and marketing , management consultancy , information technology , conferences and exhibitions will help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland enterprises as well as help enterprises and products formulate strategies to enhance their brand image .
services such as tourism , medical service , and insurance will also be conducive to promoting the development of relevant mainland markets and industries and enhancing the level of services .
close co - operation between the service sectors of the two places will greatly enhance their respective strengths and help us jointly face the opportunities and challenges of economic globalization .
to promote the development of professional services in the mainland market , the financial secretary and i had just met with officials of the relevant policy bureaux and enforcement departments and representatives of various professional sectors in beijing last week to discuss the mutual recognition of professional qualifications with the relevant mainland authorities and their counterparts , as well as other issues of concern to the industry .
i am pleased to have signed mutual recognition and co - operation agreements in the construction , structural engineering and insurance sectors , thus taking an important step in developing the mainland market .
through this meeting , hong kong 's professional bodies have also established closer ties with their mainland counterparts to lay a good foundation for further co - operation .
i believe the vast majority of hong kong people love the motherland and hong kong .
as a matter of fact , the economic , social , political , and cultural relations between the mainland and hong kong have always been very close and have been closely related before and after the reversion .
on the economic front , we see that since the four modernizations promoted by the mainland more than 20 years ago , hong kong 's industries have the opportunity to move northwards , and there is new room for development , which has already brought hong kong 's social and mainland relations closer .
in the past few days , we have further opportunities to work with the central authorities on closer economic partnership arrangement , and to open up new opportunities for various service sectors in hong kong , so that we can more actively and extensively participate in the mainland 's economic development and make new contributions to the country and hong kong . this will also make the relationship between hong kong and the mainland even closer .
on social development , we have seen a rapid development of our country in recent years .
the people of hong kong are very pleased to see beijing successfully bidding for the 2008 olympic games .
as early as a few months ago , yang liwei 's visit to hong kong was very exciting . why ?
because we feel that the country can achieve this , that is everyone , everyone in hong kong takes pride in .
i understand that the legislative council has already started discussion with the government on the long term office of the legislative council since 10 years ago .
similarly , in the past decade or so , the government has been considering the long - term plan to relocate the government secretariat .
i understand that the decision to defer the tamar development project , including the new legislative council building , will disappoint some members of the legislative council .
i understand that some members have been aggrieved to continue their work in areas with poor conditions during this period .
however , as i have said to my colleagues in the government who are equally affected by this decision , i hope that you will be able to take public interest into account and understand the situation , and be patient during this period .
i have explained to the administration panel of the legislative council on a number of occasions earlier that having regard to the current financial situation and the financial position following the outbreak of sars last year , the government does not consider it appropriate time to proceed with the tamar project or the large office building project .
deferral of the new legislative council building at tamar will help reduce the government 's fiscal pressure in the next few years and is in the public interest and acceptable to the public .
the government will re - start the construction of the new legislative council building at tamar site when the public finance situation improves .
the mainland is very concerned about hong kong and the president and prime minister are concerned about hong kong , and i know that they and the central government will do their best to do this .
so , good news will come one after another in the areas of tourism , finance , infrastructure , shipping rights , products zero tariff and service industries .
i also hope that with hong kong 's economic recovery , hong kong will be able to make greater contributions to the development of our country with its own strengths .
in my meeting with premier wen jiabao , i also represented hong kong 's congratulation on his remarkable achievements made by the country in the past very difficult years .
premier wen also told me that restudying mr. deng xiaoping 's important exposition on " one country , two systems " 20 years ago is of great significance to our comprehensive and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems " and is conducive to our future constitutional development .
he also told me that hong kong people must seize this opportunity to focus on economic development and people 's livelihood , and he was confident of hong kong .
later , i will meet with mr zhang dejiang , secretary of guangdong province , and mr huang huahua , governor of guangdong province , to discuss with them how to further enhance our co - operation and to create a win - win situation .
the last point is that recently , people are familiar with " hong kong people governing hong kong . " this system is a system that uses patriots as the mainstay to govern hong kong .
patriots also have very clear criteria for respecting their own patriots , sincerely supporting the country 's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong , and not doing things that harm the country and hong kong . this is patriots , with the patriots as the main body .
i must reiterate that hong kong people are patriotic in general .
it is not for the general public in hong kong , but for high - level officials in the administrative structure , the legislative council , and the judiciary who are involved in managing public affairs in hong kong .
when they are sworn in , they must show their support for the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china and their loyalty to the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china .
as a matter of fact , when i first talked about hong kong 's long - term future in the 1980 s and formulated the " joint statement " and the " basic law , " this set of long - term principles and policies had not changed and will not change because this is a series of long - term principles and policies for the country to resume the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong . this is the national policy that will not change .
over the past several hundred years since the birth of the intellectual property system , especially since the industrial revolution , it has hastened the birth of one major invention after another with epoch - making significance .
over the past 20 years , the intellectual property system has become the basic legal system and important policy means of various countries in promoting technological innovation , and has played an important role in invigorating the economy and increasing international competitiveness .
at present , with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization , the creation , possession , and application of knowledge and intellectual resources , and the quantity and quality of intellectual property rights have become an important foundation for various countries to participate in international competition .
therefore , strengthening international exchanges and cooperation in ipr protection is of great significance to establishing a fair and rational new international economic order and promoting world economic prosperity and development .
the chinese government attaches great importance to protecting intellectual property rights .
in the early days of reform and opening up , china began to establish an intellectual property rights system . through more than 20 years of efforts , a relatively complete legal system for intellectual property rights has been formed , and a system for protecting intellectual property rights that combines judicial and administrative law enforcement has been established . a great deal of work has been done in protecting intellectual property rights and made important contributions to promoting scientific and technological progress and economic and social development .
when mankind enters the information society in the 21 st century , the scientific and technological revolution will use an unprecedented powerful force to promote the development of the social productive forces .
further perfecting china 's system of ipr and strengthening international exchanges and cooperation in ipr protection work are the requirements for china to open itself wider to the outside world in the new century , and are also the requirement for building a socialist modern country and achieving the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
we are willing to work together with all countries in the world to establish a fair and reasonable ipr system that is conducive to promoting scientific , technological , and economic development of all countries , and to create a fine environment for all mankind to respect knowledge , respect science , and protect intellectual property rights .
accelerating the organization 's establishment of a mechanism is the most important task facing the sco at present .
through the efforts of all parties concerned , the secretariat and the regional anti - terrorist organizations have made great progress .
we must do our best to ensure that we will formally activate our secretariat this year and establish a regional anti - terrorist agency at an early date .
to show the great importance attached to the shanghai cooperation organization and to the organization 's secretariat , the chinese government has decided to provide the secretariat with office accommodation free of charge .
in the future , we will continue to provide great support for the smooth development of the secretariat .
deepening and expanding security cooperation has always been the focus of the sco 's work .
we must never relax our vigilance or tolerate the " three forces " that seriously jeopardize the interests of all member states in this region .
we should make unremitting efforts over a long period of time to eradicate these evil forces and effectively maintain the tranquillity and stability of this region .
in order to cut off the sources of funds for the " three forces " activities and more comprehensively and effectively crack down on the " three forces , " we should put the anti - narcotics issue on the agenda of security cooperation as soon as possible .
economic cooperation is an important foundation and priority of the sco .
education is the cornerstone of modern civilization .
to improve the people 's quality and increase their comprehensive national strength , we must vigorously develop education undertakings .
rural education has extensive influence , which has a bearing on the overall situation of rural economic and social development .
since the beginning of reform and opening up , tremendous and profound changes have taken place in china 's urban and rural areas . this is closely related to the development of education , especially rural education .
in rural areas , the household output - related contract responsibility system has greatly emancipated productive forces .
one of the fundamental reasons why the advanced practical technology for agriculture can be popularized on a large scale and township and town enterprises can suddenly break away from the military . the reason why the surplus labor force in rural areas can be transferred to coastal areas and cities and towns is that there are tens of millions of rural labor force once received compulsory education as the foundation and support , and great achievements have been made in popularizing compulsory education in rural areas .
at present , china 's agriculture and rural economy are at a critical stage of development . the development of fine quality , high efficiency , ecology , and safe agriculture , the expansion of agricultural industrialized operation , and the transfer of surplus rural labor forces all urgently require an overall improvement in rural labor quality .
the rise of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world and the advance of comprehensively building a well - off society have set still higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities and ideological and moral qualities of the vast rural population .
without the comprehensive " universal ninth five - year plan " in rural areas and without an all - round improvement in the quality of peasants , it will be very difficult to achieve comprehensive prosperity .
we must fully understand the basic , leading , and across - the - board role of rural education in building a well - off society in an all - round way .
advisers and guests attending the meeting included senior leaders of well - known multinational companies , renowned economists and academics .
i am deeply impressed by the sincere co - operation of the consultants and their positive and pragmatic attitude .
giving full play to our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom is conducive not only to planning and promoting guangdong 's development but also to jointly promoting cooperation and development in various fields .
i have been looking forward to the coming of the 2003 international advisory conference on economic development in guangdong to listen to and understand your heartfelt and penetrating insight about guangdong 's economic and social development .
we are gathering here today to attain the same objective : to strengthen cooperation and exchanges and expand the scope of development , add vitality to guangdong 's economic and social development , and create opportunities for your cause .
china 's accession to the wto marks the beginning of a brand new stage in opening up to the outside world . we are participating in international competition on a larger scale , in a broader scope , and at a higher level .
guangdong is the province with the highest degree of external economic orientation in mainland china , and has taken the lead in feeling unprecedented development opportunities and severe challenges .
against such a general background , we must firmly seize the new opportunities , meet the new challenges , comprehensively enhance our international competitiveness , actively advance the process of modernization , strive to open up a new prospect in economic cooperation , supplement each other 's advantages , seek mutual benefit , conduct long - term cooperation , and achieve common development .
the people of guangdong are concentrating on building a well - off society and speeding up modernization , which will create more development opportunities and space for all friends .
guangdong 's economy , which is full of vigor and vitality and has broad prospects , has been moving toward a new height with a strong posture .
a few days ago , the iraqi interim authority signed an agreement with the us occupation authorities in baghdad , announcing a step - by - step schedule of power transfer in iraq in june next year .
the agreement was reluctantly approved by the international community : although the eu foreign ministers ' meeting welcomed it , france said " the process is too slow " . while un secretary general annan " was encouraged " by the power transfer plan , he said that the " timing " for the un to play its role in iraq is not yet ripe , but russia simply questioned the legitimacy of the agreement .
the iraqi public reacted cold , and the us media even held that " this is a major gambling activity . "
in short , people mostly have a skeptical and skeptical attitude .
there is no reason why the international community has all kinds of doubts and misgivings .
as people see , returning to iraq is not a move that the united states is willing to take . therefore , the power transfer cannot be thorough and will inevitably leave behind a lot of hints .
first , the interim government to be established in may next year will not be directly elected by the iraqi people , but will be elected by the 18 provincial - level election committee as a " transitional national congress . "
this can hardly avoid being manipulated by the united states , and its legitimacy may be challenged .
second , after the united states announced its power transfer , the us military did not withdraw but turned the original " military occupation " into " military presence . "
the us government announced on 18 november that it has decided to impose quotas on three textile products imported from china , including knitwear , chest clothes , and fellow fees .
at a time when china is constantly striving to expand economic and trade cooperation between china and the united states , the us government 's trade protectionist measures cannot but arouse deep regret .
with the development of economic globalization to date , it is extremely inappropriate for the united states to impose new restrictions on chinese textile imports .
first of all , this abusive " quota " measure restricts the implementation of the wto 's free trade principle .
on the one hand , they talk glibly about " free trade , " but on the other hand , they are prone to let out the " quota " cold arrows and re-erect trade barriers . does this appear to be overly arbitrary and fair ?
second , the " quota " has restricted the good development momentum of sino - us economic and trade relations .
since china and the united states reached an agreement on china 's wto entry in 1999 , us exports to china have increased by an average annual rate of 15 percent .
from january to september of this year , us exports to china increased by 26.2 percent over the same period last year .
in the past two years , us exports of raw materials and finished products to china increased sharply .
in fact , today 's china has become the fastest - growing nation in us exports to various countries .
the main reason why bush 's visit to britain was unable to achieve his goal was that after the end of the cold war , the united states has become the only superpower in the world and has not taken other people 's eye or unilateralism .
without un authorization , the united states launched the war against iraq , and did not respect the opinions of its major allies on major international issues such as the reconstruction of iraq .
a recent poll by the european commission shows that 68 percent of eu citizens believe that the reason for the united states to launch the iraq war is insufficient , while 53 percent believe that the united states poses a threat to world peace .
second , the united states stresses anti - terrorism and wants the allies to provide funding , but it does not care about issues of concern to them .
with regard to the iraqi reconstruction project , clench at the expense of his own company , the us 's main contract for the first tendering was not willing to shed a glass of soup , the world trade organization has already made a ruling that the united states has imposed high tariffs , and the british business community had hoped that bush could make concessions on this trip , but ultimately did not make clear its position .
third , the united states takes its own values as the highest standard above other countries and insists on carrying out democratic transformation of middle east countries . it is reproached by some allies demanding that the united states respect the cultures and characteristics of islamic countries . it believes that one of the reasons why the us military landed deep in iraq today is the bitter consequence of its " non-respect . "
however , bush will not change on account of widespread criticism and opposition . during his visit , he once again defended his iraq policy and stressed that the us - british coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with violence in iraq .
since bush 's current visit to britain failed to meet his wish , the situation in iraq did not have to develop as the white house hoped .
after six months of debate , the advance team of japan 's self - defense forces finally went to iraq before the end of 2003 .
this is the first time that japan has sent troops overseas since world war ii .
it reflects japan 's will to become a political and military power and also marks the beginning of a change in japan 's defense strategy .
the reason why the sdf 's visit attracted people 's attention was that it was not an isolated incident .
taking advantage of the afghan war to achieve a breakthrough in the self - defense force 's entry into the country , japan passed a " emergency legal system " on the korean peninsula , thus foreshadowing the use of force or even preemptive force by the self - defense forces . recently , the koizumi cabinet also adopted the " basic plan to support iraq 's reconstruction " to pave the way for sending troops to iraq .
this step has finally broken through the restriction of japan 's peace constitution and achieved the goal of sending troops overseas .
in addition , japan is also preparing to revise its " basic defense forces concept " in 2004 in order to legalize and biennially dispatch troops overseas , and also plans to send a non-temporary " permanent force " overseas .
at the same time , under the pretext of the so - called " dprk missile threat , " the japanese cabinet meeting made a decision to start deploying the missile defense system in early 2004 and introduce the us - made " standard - 3 " and " patriot - 3 " missiles to intercept missiles from outside the atmosphere and return to the atmosphere , thereby building a double - guided missile interception network .
it is not difficult to see that the japanese sdf is now developing toward a military orientation characterized by " both offensive and defensive " , and the so - called " exclusively defensive forces " seems to exist in name only .
the reason why japan 's action has attracted people 's attention is , first of all , that these military decisions are an impact on japan 's constitution of peace .
after visiting the yasukuni shrine , koizumi was interviewed by japanese reporters and defended his own action .
his arguments contradicted himself and left nothing out .
the reporter asked why koizumi visited the shrine . koizumi replied that " japan 's peace and prosperity were achieved on the basis of those who were victims of the war .
the purpose of my visit is to pray for japan 's peace and prosperity . "
may i ask whether the so - called " war victims " of koizumi also include class - a war criminals of world war ii such as hideki tojo ?
do you mean that there are also class - a war criminals contributing to peace and prosperity in japan after world war ii ?
a reporter asked : why did you choose to visit the yasukuni shrine on 1 january ?
koizumi said that the first day of the new year is japan 's tradition , and many people visited the shrine on that day .
it is understandable that ordinary people mourn their relatives and friends , and many family members have specifically stated that their visit to the yasukuni shrine is only to mourn their loved ones and friends , and they are resolutely opposed to the shrine where class a war criminals are enshrined .
the chinese people are rational , and we have always insisted on differentiating the japanese people from a small number of militarists , separating ordinary people from right - wing elements , and that paying respects at the yasukuni shrine by ordinary people is not the crux of historical problems .
unity is strength .
this is an irrefutable truth .
to realize the grand objective of comprehensively building a comfortably well - off society and accomplish the sacred cause of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation , we must unite all forces that can be united .
the patriotic united front work and the cppcc work in the new stage in the new century must take this as the fundamental starting point and the end result .
we must further uphold and perfect the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the cpc , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front , fully mobilize all positive factors in the most extensive and full , and continually add new strength to the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
over the past year , the cppcc firmly grasped the two main themes of unity and democracy , seriously performed its various functions , and played an important role in promoting china 's all - round economic and social development and safeguarding the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .
in the new year , it is hoped that the cppcc will continue to do a good job in political consultation , democratic supervision , and participation in and discussion of state affairs by closely centering on the central tasks of the party and the state ; carry forward its fine tradition ; give play to its own advantages ; carry out in - depth investigation and study ;
from 4 to 6 january , the 12th summit meeting of the south asian regional cooperation union ( south asian league ) , which was postponed for a whole year , was held in islamabad . the meeting approved the " framework treaty of free trade in south asia , " the " added protocol to the south asian alliance convention on fighting terrorism , " and the " south asian society charter . " it announced that all member countries of the south asian league will devote themselves to common development and cooperation in the economic , cultural ,
during the south league summit , the bilateral meetings between indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president pervez musharraf attracted particular attention .
at the last summit , the handshake between musharraf and vajpayee did not place much hope on the development of relations between the two countries .
two years later , because the two sides adopted a series of major measures to restore normal diplomatic relations , land - to - air communications ties , and cease fire in the kashmir region , indian - pakistani relations continued to ease up and finally reached the highest level of meeting by taking advantage of the asean summit meeting .
the two countries have made another big step forward in the process of improving their bilateral relations , and the south asian regional cooperation is ushering in a new turn for the better .
indian foreign minister singh said on 4 may that the meeting was " courtesy , " but people believe that the meeting means that india - pakistan relations will continue to move in a more positive and pragmatic direction .
the leaders of the two countries have realized that tensions and confrontations do not accord with their own interests , and on the contrary cause an opportunity for economic development to be missed .
with the further development of economic globalization , strengthening cooperation and reviving the economy has become the top priority of the two governments .
although the results of the presidential election held in georgia on 4 may have not been officially announced , the victory of saakashvili , the candidate jointly selected by the right - wing political party and leader of the national movement party , is certain .
the georgian central election commission announced on the 7th that more than 95 percent of the electorate support saakashvili .
the leaders of some cis countries also sent congratulatory messages to this young politician .
in fact , saakashvili already declared victory on the night when the election ended .
he described the result as " a victory for the people " and said that georgia would take quick action to open up a new future .
in an interview with the media , many voters said that casting their votes to saakashvili means choosing " new hope . "
even former president shevardnardze , who was forced to resign , also expressed his support for this former political enemy . he praised him as " young , vigorous , and excellent education . "
while pinning hopes on saakashvili , people have also noticed that there has been no major change in the situation in georgia in the past two months since shevardnadze resigned .
it can be said that the newly elected president will still face the same old problem .
the past year was an important and unusual year in china 's development process .
we have waged an arduous struggle against sars and scored a major victory in a certain stage ; our country 's economy has maintained a good development momentum , with per capita gdp topping 1,000 us dollars , and the " shenzhou - 5 " manned spaceflight successfully , the chinese nation has become a dream , national unity , social progress , and further improvement of people 's living standards .
the achievements in various fields in our country have attracted worldwide attention . the people throughout the country have made tremendous efforts to this end . they have demonstrated their courage and strength in defying hardship and danger and creating miracles .
looking forward to the new year , we are full of confidence and hope .
taking a comprehensive view of the international and domestic situations , our country is in an important strategic opportunity period that must be firmly grasped and can be accomplished .
we must take deng xiaoping theory and the important thinking of the " three represents " as our guide , fully implement the spirit of the 16th party congress and the third plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee , seriously implement the central authorities ' general principles and arrangements for this year 's work , and continue to push forward reform , opening up , and modernization .
to do this year 's work well , we must correctly grasp the situation . we must not only see favorable conditions and new opportunities , but also see unfavorable conditions and new challenges and enhance our sense of responsibility , sense of urgency , and sense of crisis .
the three - party talks on the iraq issue were held at the un headquarters in new york on the 19th . un secretary general annan held talks with representatives of the iraqi interim governing council and the us - british coalition provisional management authorities to discuss how the united nations could play a role in iraq 's reconstruction .
the three sides frankly exchanged views on political , humanitarian , security , and the appointment of the un special representative in iraq .
at a time when the us and british proposals for the transfer of power in iraq were being boycotted , the question of whether or not the united nations should intervene in the reconstruction of iraq has naturally attracted people 's attention .
since the united states announced the end of major battles in iraq in early may last year , the situation in iraq has continued to be turbulent and attacks against occupation have occurred one after another , with the result that the us - british coalition forces have suffered numerous casualties and almost no peace day .
former iraqi president saddam was captured on 13 december last year , but the us joy has not been sustained , the security situation has not improved , and the intensification of the resistance movement has put the occupation authorities in a predicament .
on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab countries unanimously demand that foreign troops withdraw and return to iraq to let the iraqi people manage their own country .
at the same time , the united states and britain are striving to remold the iraqi regime in line with their own will , and on the basis of this , they are gradually taking off from the morass .
for this reason , the way and process of power transfer has become the focus of iraq 's current affairs .
the proposal put forward by the us and british authorities for the handover of power with the iraqi interim governing council last november was : the iraqi interim government , which was formed before 1 july this year , will be elected by the " interim national assembly , " but the representatives attending the meeting will be " chosen by the provincial election committee . "
and the shiites , who account for the majority of the iraqi population , stressed that if iraq is to really return to politics in a fair way , it should hold national direct elections .
us secretary of state powell 's recent visit to russia was still a focus of public opinion 's attention .
on the one hand , this is because the united states and russia hold a decisive position and their mutual relations have a far - reaching impact on the world today .
more importantly , powell 's moscow trip was substantive and sent a clear signal : clouds have appeared in the sky of russian - us relations .
if these dark clouds are not dispersed in good time , the prospects for the two countries ' relations may become dim .
although the channels of dialogue between washington and moscow are very clear , powell decided to write an article on russia 's influential " information source " to explain his stance .
in his article , powell pointed out that the united states was perplexed by a series of incidents in russia 's internal and diplomatic spheres over the past few months .
he held that the russian regime has yet to completely accept legal restraint , and that the key elements of freedom of the press , the development of political parties , and other citizens are not solid enough .
the united states is even more worried about russia 's policy in chechnya and its attitude toward neighboring countries of the cis .
in the eyes of diplomats , making use of the mass media to publicly express their attitude is the " last way " to communicate information .
the original intention of the united states in making such a choice is thought - provoking , and it is obvious that russia feels embarrassed and is not quick at all .
( international ) us flu spread to peak
xinhua news agency report of december 31 from los angeles ( by staff reporter yan liang ) - the centers for disease control and prevention in the united states said on the 31 st that the unseen flu in the united states for more than 30 years has reached its peak , with 45 out of 50 states across the united states having a large - scale flu spread , resulting in a rapid increase in the number of deaths caused by influenza .
according to the statistics of the center as of december 20 , the number of deaths caused by influenza in the united states has set a record high of 7.8 percent of all deaths in the same period .
at least 42 children died of influenza in the united states , and the number of deaths from adults also rose rapidly , but it is not yet accurate at this moment .
experts believe that there are two reasons for the serious spread of influenza in 2003 : first , the flu virus is not a panacea for influenza viruses in previous years , causing an earlier production of vaccines not to be able to effectively prevent the virus . second , the oversupply of flu vaccines in the united states last year and two companies that mainly supply vaccines this year have reduced the production volume to 83 million , resulting in the failure of vaccine supply this year .
despite an average of 36,000 people die of influenza each year in the united states and 1.14 million people are hospitalized due to influenza , it is still very rare to have a certain degree of social panic like this .
william thompson , a us epidemiologist , said that this influenza was the most serious influenza in the united states in the past 30 years and was even earlier than in previous years . many schools had a large - scale flu spread and many places where influenza was injected had lined up .
in the face of such a grim situation , the us ministry of health started the emergency center on 19 december and sent a medical expert team to various states .
recently , high - pathogenic avian flu has occurred successively in some parts of china .
the party central committee and the state council have attached great importance to this , rapidly made a series of major policy decisions , and clearly put forward the guiding principles and policies for the prevention and treatment work .
the localities and departments concerned started to act urgently and spare no effort to prevent the epidemic from spreading in accordance with the plans of the party central committee and the state council .
at present , the national avian flu prevention and control work is being carried out in a tense and orderly manner .
the highly pathogenic avian flu is a type of animal epidemic disease spreading rapidly and endangering people 's health and safety .
all localities and departments must take the important thinking of the " three represents " as the guide , act in line with the requirements of the " people 's republic of china animal epidemic prevention law , " strengthen leadership and coordination , rely on science , prevent and control according to law , and resolutely implement the measures of preventing and controlling avian flu in mass destruction .
as the largest debtor country in the world , the amount of us foreign debts is increasing again .
the us treasury department announced on 16 january that by the end of september of last year , the total amount of debt owed to foreign creditors of all kinds had reached 6.494 trillion us dollars , 2.2 percent higher than the previous figure .
on average , every american is already responsible for over 20,000 us dollars of foreign debts .
coincidentally , one week ago , the imf 's research report system sharp sounded the alarm for the us financial foundation that was shaking . it also pointed out that us foreign debt , which has constantly broken through , has reached a level threatening global financial stability .
statistics show that foreign private investors control about 40 percent of us government bonds .
this unavoidably makes people think of the first half of the 20 th century when kaenos delivered to president roosevelt : it is necessary to adopt a fiscal policy internally to stimulate the economy , and its fiscal deficit is resolved through debt issuance .
this move has indeed played an important role in stimulating " effective demand " and helping to get out of pressing needs of economic crisis .
however , people see that many us administrations tend to take this as a " panacea . "
however , since president reagan proposed tax reduction and arms expansion in the 1980 s , the us fiscal deficit has gradually increased and finally become the biggest debtor .
the convening of the first round of the six - party talks is an important step taken in the process of a peaceful solution to the korean peninsula nuclear issue .
some points in common that various parties have formed during the talks have laid the necessary foundation for the talks to continue and have further clarified the objectives , approaches , and guidelines for resolving the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula .
over the past few months , all parties concerned have persisted in peacefully resolving the peninsula nuclear issue through dialogue . on the basis of the results of the first round of six - party talks , they extensively conducted coordination and consultations at various levels , and made unremitting efforts to hold the second round of talks as early as possible .
at the same time , the dprk and the united states have also further demonstrated flexibility in varying degrees .
now important progress has been made in the preparations for the talks , and it is the popular feeling for them to make a good start .
the results of the second round of the six - party talks and whether the peace process can be maintained are the concerns of all parties concerned and the international community .
in response to this , a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry said that the objective of the six - party talks is to maintain and promote the process of a peaceful settlement of disputes . we are willing to work together with all parties concerned in this regard .
china 's basic starting point is to safeguard peace and stability on the korean peninsula and to realize denuclearization of the peninsula .
the chinese side believes that so long as all parties concerned adhere to the sincerity of the peace talks , respect each other , and hold consultations on an equal footing , they will be able to create favorable conditions for promoting the settlement of relevant issues .
in the late 1970 's , the relationship between the two countries deteriorated , and in 1981 , the two countries severed diplomatic relations .
us president reagan listed a series of crimes for the libyan leader qadhafi , such as accusing him of secretly developing nuclear weapons and engaging in military intervention and terrorism abroad .
the two sides exchanged words with each other , and the united states launched two surgical airstrikes -- the " grassland fire " and the " golden gorge . "
after that , the united states imposed economic sanctions on libya , struck political blows at libya , carried out diplomatic containment , and threatened military threats .
and qadhafi under pressure did not yield .
at present , when us - roc relations are warming up again , some people are totally attributable to the deterrent effect of the iraq war and seem to be biased .
as a matter of fact , over many years , qadhafi , who has a unique personality , has been struggling with the united states . on the other hand , he has been throwing out olive branches to the united states , but unfortunately he has not received any response .
after the iraq war ended , all parties in the middle east readjusted their strategies and re-organized their regional forces , thus providing an opportunity for us to resume diplomatic relations with china .
as far as qadhafi is concerned , by repairing sanctions , reviving the economy , improving people 's livelihood , extricating itself from its isolation , and fusing into the international community .
it is beneficial to give up those things that are not yet available and can not be realized for the time being .
from 7 to 8 february , important political figures from europe , the united states , and other regions gathered in munich , germany , to attend the 40th munich security policy conference .
the so - called " munich security policy conference " was founded by non-government personages in germany and sponsored by the german government on international security issues . in recent years , especially after the " 9.11 " campaign , it has attracted increasing attention from people and has been praised as the " davos forum " in the security field .
one of the important topics of this meeting was cross - atlantic relations .
the remarks made at the meeting by important eu and us political figures show that the two sides are exerting themselves to shake off the shadow of the iraq war on bilateral relations and are striving to return to the track of cooperation .
bertram , director of the berlin institute for international and security affairs , said that this was a meeting between europe and the united states to repair relations , and both sides had the desire to move closer .
as far as european - us relations are concerned , the new message emanated by the meeting is that europe and the united states need to restart dialogue , and need to seriously consider the common tasks facing both sides and to find a convergence of the interests needed to accomplish these common tasks .
compared with last year 's meeting , the smell of gunpowder in this year 's meeting disappeared and both sides ' positions were close .
although the " old europe " represented by france and germany still stuck to their senses in launching the iraq war , they said they would " look forward to the past . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the meeting : " although we have different views on the war , we must work together to ensure that peace in iraq has been realized after the war and we must look forward to this . "
he added that although germany would not dispatch troops to iraq , germany would not obstruct nato from playing a direct role in iraq .
the united states , which has seized the initiative in the field of modern media , has monopolized a large portion of the right to speak international news . the tentacles of its media publicity have long spread around the world , and have reached a level beyond all limits . why is it still going to spend a huge sum of money on establishing satellite tv stations with 22 middle east countries ?
in the words of the person in charge of the " freedom no . 1 " television station , it is to provide arab countries with a " comprehensive and just " news platform of view . "
an analyst , however , pointed out that " freedom no . 1 " will be a strategic weapon of the united states in carrying out public opinion infiltration , carrying out cultural invasion , and attacking heart - to - heart attacks against arab countries , and an important propaganda tool for the united states to pursue the policy of integrating the middle east and transforming the islamic world .
in view of this , the mission of " freedom no . 1 " is quite unusual . there are mainly three who choose their key positions : the first is to spread the " concept of freedom . "
the united states believes that islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the promotion of modern civilization by the west . the extremist religious forces in the middle east islamic countries are the hotbed created by international terrorism with anti-us characteristics . in order to effectively counter terrorism , it must reconstruct the islamic world and recognize and accept the western values , lifestyles and political systems .
the united states is trying to imperceptibly effect the " freedom no . 1 " program by inculcating its own ideology and other things to its arabs .
second , to improve the us image .
the united states is pursuing unilateralism and trying to flaunt its power on a series of international issues . it is strongly opposed to it and holds the bully of the arab countries and the islamic world .
after the " 9.11 " incident , the contradictions between the united states and the middle east islamic world , which has always been biased toward israel , became more intense .
without conclusive evidence and un authorization , the united states has seized and occupied iraq by force under the name of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and anti-terrorism , thus arousing strong resentment among muslims .
the talks between pakistani and indian officials were held in islamabad from february 16 - 18 , with the hope for peace rising again on the south asian continent .
officials of the two countries have set the agenda and model for future talks and set up a mechanism for continuing dialogue , which marks the restart of the pakistan - india dialogue process two years after it has been suspended , laying a foundation for the two countries to gradually resolve all outstanding issues , including the kashmir dispute , and embodies the valuable sincerity of both sides for peace .
prior to the talks , although a series of goodwill moves of the two countries have been turned into warm and harmonious , the analysts still hold a cautious attitude toward the prospects of the peace process .
it is no wonder that looking back at the emergency ups and downs in the relations between pakistan and india in recent years , it seems that no one dare guarantee the emergency : today , the sun on the negotiating table will light , and tomorrow will not turn into a flash thunder on the border .
however , the statement of the two countries read with a smile on the 18th by pakistan 's foreign affairs secretary , the two countries indeed filled the air of optimism , brightening the eyes of many people who have long been concerned about the situation in south asia .
first of all , the timetable set for the talks was very practicable . the two sides not only specified the time and agenda for the talks but also specified different levels of talks according to the importance of the topics .
second , the two sides learned from the lessons of the direct dialogue between the leaders of the two countries at the agra summit in july 2001 that led to the failure of the talks , and adopted the " step - by - step " method of dialogue so that the level of the talks can be carried out from low to high , so as to make full preparations for high - level dialogue .
third , after experiencing several occasions of bilateral relations , both countries unanimously agreed that war is not a good way of settling disputes . the two sides should stay away from war . this consensus has laid a foundation for the leaders of the two countries to reach an understanding that " there will be no more war between india and pakistan . "
to comprehensively and accurately understand and implement the principle of " one country , two systems , " it is necessary to integrate " one country " with " two systems , " " loving the country " with " loving hong kong , " integrate the respect for hong kong 's high degree of autonomy with safeguarding national sovereignty , and integrate the maintenance of hong kong 's capitalism with the adherence to socialism as the main body of the state .
only in this way will it be possible to safeguard the well - being of hong kong compatriots and the long - term interests of the state and the entire people .
since hong kong 's reversion to china , the central government has unswervingly implemented the policy of " one country , two systems " and acted in strict accordance with the basic law .
the vast number of hong kong compatriots enjoy unprecedented democratic rights in their status as masters of the country .
with the strong support of the central government and the interior of the motherland , hong kong has overcome all kinds of risks and challenges , such as the impact of the asian financial crisis , and has continued to maintain its status as an international financial , trade , and shipping center .
practice has proven that the principle of " one country , two systems " has strong vitality .
today , we republished comrade deng xiaoping 's speech 20 years ago and again declared to the world the firm determination of the central authorities to implement the " one country , two systems " policy . it is also for the purpose of letting everyone comprehensively and accurately understand the " one country , two systems " principle and continuously advance the great practice of " one country , two systems . "
the party central committee and the state council ceremoniously held a national science and technology award meeting here today .
president hu jintao presented awards to academicians liu dongsheng and wang yongzhi , who won the national highest science and technology award for 2003 .
the meeting presented awards to science and technology workers who won the national scientific and technological progress award and the 2003 national natural science award , the national technical invention award , and the national scientific and technological progress award .
on behalf of the party central committee and the state council , i would like to extend warm congratulations to all the award winners !
he extended sincere greetings and lofty respects to scientific and technological personnel on all fronts throughout the country !
for our country , the first two decades of this century are an important strategic opportunity period that must be tightly grasped and can be accomplished .
we should concentrate our efforts on building a better - off society that benefits more than one billion people .
to make good use of this strategic opportunity period and strive to do something , we must put the development of science and technology in a more important and prominent position .
after the " 9.11 " incident , us president bush dished out the " preemptive " strategy in june 2002 and put it into practice in us foreign relations . in march last year , he fought the first " preemptive " war in iraq .
the idea of " preemptive strikes " not only runs counter to the norms of international law with " mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity " as the core , but also inevitably brings about the danger of mass emulation , and a new turbulent situation will arise in international order .
when the theory of " preemptive strikes " appeared , some important political figures in the united states asked this question : " if other countries follow the example one after another , what to do ? "
as expected , in the past two years , more and more countries have claimed to " preemptive " themselves , and the ranks of " preemptive strikes " are expanding .
this is a new trend worthy of our attention and study .
in the month when bush came up with the strategy of " preemptive strikes , " australian prime minister howard was the first to come forward to express his support .
he said that once relevant terrorists were able to attack australia , australia would adopt a " preemptive " strategy and would not hesitate to take military actions against neighboring countries .
he even proposed incorporating the principle of " preemptive strikes " into the un charter , holding that it is necessary to amend the un charter and give " preemptive " rights to various countries to crack down on terrorists or countries that support terrorist activities .
in the northeast asian region , the japanese defense agency published a " defense white paper " in july 1999 , which pointed out that japan can launch a " preemptive " attack on foreign bases before it faces missile attacks or military invasion .
after the iraq war , the calls of japan for its " preemptive " strategy were even more rife and rampant .
recently , international opinion has made many comments on the current us african policy .
the " foreign policy focus , " published by the united states in january this year , carried an article entitled " prospects for africa 's policy in 2004 . " the article said : in the past year , the foreign policy of the bush administration has directly or indirectly exerted a negative impact on africa . in particular , due to the united states ' all - out concern over the anti-terrorism war and the issue of weapons of mass destruction , especially the united states ' playing no - game in iraq , the united states
people still remember that in order to show concern for africa , the bush administration formulated the " president 's aids prevention emergency plan " in january last year and promised to provide at least $ 3 - billion of funds annually for africa .
in july last year , president bush visited five african countries , including senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda , and nigeria , where he promised to provide 15 - billion us dollars in aid to the prevention and cure of aids in african countries , and another 100 - million us dollars was used to crack down on terrorist activities in africa . he also announced the food emergency aid program and the education aid program .
the assistance projects were once welcomed by african countries and they have won much praise internationally .
however , one year has passed and the concrete actions of the united states have been delayed .
africa is in urgent need of aid .
after entering the new century , africa is faced with all kinds of development challenges . in order to achieve the " goals for development in the century , " which was formulated by the united nations in 2000 , africa has worked hard to reduce hunger and poverty , promote health and education . africa has established the " african union " to coordinate affairs across the continent and formulated the " new african development partner plan " that is aimed at promoting the development of various countries . however , owing to its economic foundation , it has
the united nations has called on developed countries to use 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product for official aid to the least developed countries .
however , the us official aid accounted for only 0.1 percent of its gross domestic product , far from the un 's request , and ranked the last on the list of countries that donated .
recently , european public opinion has been discussing a hot topic : whether the meeting between german chancellor schroeder and french president chirac and british prime minister blair is gradually moving toward systematization .
public opinion calls germany , france , and britain , these " three magnates " as the " new three chariots " of the eu , while relations among the three countries are termed the " new triangle . "
although the " new triangle " is a new thing , we still need to observe what course it will go , considering from any angle , generally speaking , the " new triangle " seems to be beneficial to the european integration process , and will benefit europe as a pole in the international arena .
taking a panoramic view of the 100 - year history of europe , one of the basic characteristics of the german - british triangular relationship is : britain and france join hands to restrain or resist germany .
the two world wars have proven this .
during the cold war , the eastern and western germany were suppressed in china and nato respectively .
after the end of the cold war , germany became even stronger after the reunification , with the setup of western european forces becoming imbalanced , and france became more skeptical . as a result , the " germany - france axis " once lost its effectiveness , and this again made britain and france approach each other , with the intention of containing germany .
however , in recent years , with the reactivation of the " axis of virtue " and the fierce collision between the world 's unipolar and multipolar ideas , the eu has been bogged down in a serious split on the iraq issue .
the " old europe " represented by germany and france is entirely contrary to the stand of the " new europe " represented by britain and poland on the iraq war issue .
the current split also coincided with the eu 's upcoming largest expansion in history .
egyptian president hosni mubarak made a statement on the reform of arab countries in cairo a few days ago , criticizing the outside world for putting a single model of reform into arab countries , and warning that such an attempt can only help but not benefit the security and stability of the middle east region .
he held that reform measures should be carried out according to their own characteristics , but the unitary reform model neglects the cultural backgrounds , social customs , and religious characteristics of different countries .
at the same time , he pointed out that arab countries welcome foreign help in the course of reform , but such efforts should be made to recognize the different conditions and respect the wishes of all countries , so as to promote the political , economic , and cultural reforms of arab countries .
the egyptian leader 's remarks represent the common views of arab countries .
under the pressure of counter - terrorism , antiproliferation , and democratic reform , the middle east , as one of the hot spots in the world , is brewing new turbulence and will lead to new integration .
after the two wars in afghanistan and iraq , how should iraq , which was once regarded by the united states as one of the " axis of evil , " carry out political reconstruction ?
how will various political and social models in the middle east develop ?
this is not only an issue of concern to the arab world and the international community , but also the interest of the united states and its western allies .
us secretary of state powell reiterated on 9 august after meeting with visiting crown prince salman of bahrain that the united states would pursue " western - style democracy and capitalism " in iraq and the middle east .
he also stressed : " we are considering what we can do and how we can systemize these things . "
last year was the " culture and education year " defined by the ioc .
the bocog made use of this opportunity to organize a series of educational activities aimed at disseminating advanced culture and popularizing olympic knowledge .
among them , the publication of the ' olympic knowledge reader for middle school students ' mainly with young people as its readers is a very important result .
this reader 's text is parallel and luxuriant , mainly in the form of speaking stories , displaying in a lively way the knowledge about the olympic movement and the essence of the olympic spirit . it is a good teaching material that helps enhance the youngsters ' understanding of the olympic games and helps to enhance their enthusiasm in participating in the games .
last year , the beijing olympic games organizing committee specially designed for teenage students a timetable made of recycled paper with the beijing olympic games logo .
the concept of " green olympics " is to make preparations for and host the olympic games with the concept of protecting the environment and protecting the ecological balance .
we hope that these curriculums will be able to regulate the behavior of young students as they did during classes , so that they will gradually become practitioners and propagators of the " green olympics " concept .
education is one of the core contents of the olympic games and also an important embodiment of the " humanistic olympics . "
the real purpose of the olympic games is to educate young people in a new way from a new angle and to promote the harmonious physical and mental development of young people , thus making contributions to building a peaceful and beautiful world .
therefore , the combination of sports and education has not only opened up a new world for the development of education , but also made the olympic movement more educational .
the " green olympics " is one of the three major concepts for beijing to host the 2008 olympic games .
the core content is to greatly improve the capital 's environmental quality and create a beautiful environment and an ecological city for the olympics .
to this end , it is necessary to extensively adopt environmental protection technology and means , to promote environmental control on a large scale , to beautify urban and rural areas and to develop environmental protection industries , to constantly enhance the entire society 's sense of environmental protection , and to encourage the public to take an active part in various activities to improve the ecological environment .
doing a good job in implementing the " green olympics " is an important task in implementing the idea of taking man as the foundation put forward by the third plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee , establishing a comprehensive , coordinated , and sustainable scientific outlook on development , and promoting beijing 's comprehensive , coordinated , and sustainable economic and social development .
we must attach great importance to it .
in order to realize the goal of the green olympics , beijing municipality has drawn up the " olympic action plan " and the " ecological and environmental protection plan " on the basis of the " 10th five - year plan " and the " report on the application " and formulated new objectives and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .
the goal of holding a green olympic games will be comprehensively realized through planned and step - by - step implementation .
on 25 february , the us state department published the " country reports on human rights practices in 2003 , " which once again assessed the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions , including china . it was a complete " teacher " who kissed the human rights situation in many countries , saying that the human rights conditions in many countries were not good , that they did not reach the standards of the united states , and that some countries had regressed and returned to the critical spheres of human rights
of course , some countries have greatly improved their human rights situation , such as afghanistan and iraq , but this is the " credit " of the us armed forces in overthrowing the former regime and " liberating " the two countries .
as for the human rights situation in the united states ?
as in previous years , the report is reluctant to talk about it .
on 1 march , the information office of the state council of china issued the " us human rights record of 2003 " to make up for the deficiencies in the us human rights report .
the article , based on a host of facts , introduces the existing human rights problems in the united states and the human rights infringement of other countries by the united states .
in the history of americans , they have a tradition of speaking honesty and a tradition of acknowledging the mistakes .
the story of george washington cutting the cherry tree when it was small is a vivid example .
now that the united states is the only superpower in the world , it does not make a lot of nonsense .
recently , reports on china 's economic development in japan 's mainstream media have quietly changed .
contrary to the " china threat theory " of the past , many reports in japan have begun to believe that china 's economic development has promoted japan 's economic recovery and that china 's robust market demand has become an important driving force for japan 's economic development .
the us newsweek recently also carried an article saying that china 's rise to prominence is an opportunity , not a threat , to other countries , especially to neighboring countries .
the so - called " china threat theory " has been replaced by the " china opportunity theory . "
the " china threat theory " asserts that china 's development will pose a threat to other countries , especially its neighbors .
however , this remark aimed at sowing dissension was not accepted by china 's neighboring countries .
former malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad said bluntly , " asian countries need not fear china 's growing military and economic strength because china has no tradition of conquering foreign countries . "
in its long - range plan , the indian defense ministry also held that china has no military threat to india .
in the economic and trade field , governments and enterprises of all countries take china as their best choice in opening up markets , and overseas investors with strategic insight are firmly using their actions to write the " china opportunity theory " : among the world 's top 500 enterprises , over 400 have made investment in china .
for several years in a row , china ranked first in the world in attracting foreign capital .
gwp is an important macroeconomic indicator for the world general population .
it is of utmost importance to maintain the growth of general dcp in the entire process of china 's modernization .
by increasing every one percentage point of our country 's general tep , we can correspondingly increase jobs of over 800,000 people . we must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth .
to a large extent , the realization of the grand objective of comprehensively building a comfortably well - off society and the realization of the third - step strategic objective of the modernization drive depends on the sustained and rapid growth of the general ranks .
however , we should realize that there are also shortcomings in the general tep index .
for example , it is not easy to accurately reflect the quality and structure of economic growth and easily reflect the level of social welfare enjoyed by the people , nor can it accurately measure social distribution and social justice .
on the other hand , gwp is not the only one .
not simply looking at the growth of general dose , we should also look at the actual material and cultural life of the masses . we should see the employment situation , social security , and even social justice , social order , social management , and social harmony .
therefore , we should adopt a scientific spirit , a scientific attitude , and a scientific way of thinking in dealing with the existing general dlaw accounting system and straighten out the general dose 's position in the entire economic and social development .
we must maintain a certain growth rate and must not be too serious or one - sidedly pursued .
since the security council delegation visited six countries in late june last year , although the situation in individual countries had once resurfaced , the overall situation in the region has undergone encouraging changes .
we are pleased to note that the sierra leone government has made positive progress in enhancing its military and police capability , in strengthening its control of domestic diamond trade , and in organizing local government elections . the unmik has also gradually reduced its size according to established plan .
what is equally gratifying is that , with the deployment of the un peacekeeping mission in libya , liberia is gradually extricating itself from the influence of prolonged war and is beginning to embark on the road of restoring and rebuilding .
the political process in guinea bissau has also made positive progress and the interim government has promised to hold legislative elections in march this year .
the peace process in cote d ' ivoire has seen a turn after suffering setbacks . various parties have promised to implement the " liana - makud agreement " and the " new army " will return to the national reconciliation government . the security council is studying the issue of sending peacekeeping operations to cote d ' ivoire .
we look forward to an early decision by the security council .
the secretariat , the western african economic community , and the parties concerned have also worked hard to resolve cross - border problems , such as small weapons , employment and mercenary troops , and children 's soldiers from the regional perspective , and have achieved positive results .
when we fully affirm the above progress , we should notice that the overall situation in west africa is still fragile . in particular , due to geographical and historical reasons , various countries in the region have close ties and influence each other . turbulence in a country often affects neighboring countries or even the entire region .
therefore , as recommended by the security council report , the international community , including the un security council , must persist in adopting a comprehensive and comprehensive strategy in resolving the issue of west africa and make great efforts to resolve relevant cross - border issues . at the same time , it is necessary to actively help relevant countries , the african union , the western africa economic community , and other regional and sub-regional organizations to strengthen their ability in preventing and resolving conflicts .
we have a common understanding that children are the future of the world .
we have the obligation to create the best and most suitable conditions for them so that they can live and learn for their growth , maturity and success .
it is regrettable , however , that there are still tens of thousands of children in today 's world suffering from armed conflicts .
what they have experienced is turmoil and backwardness . what they see is violence and sabotage . what they suffer is damage and maltreatment , and what they feel is sorrowful and helpless .
therefore , protecting children from the harm of armed conflicts is an important duty of the international community .
all countries , especially the conflicting parties , should make the greatest efforts to this end .
we are pleased to see that in recent years , the united nations has adopted a series of measures to promote the protection of children in armed conflicts and have achieved positive results .
the security council successively passed four resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) , 1379 ( 2001 ) , and 1460 ( 2003 ) , providing an important framework for child protection work .
the un peacekeeping operations in some regions take protecting children as an important task , including the appointment of child protection advisers , and the full consideration of children 's special needs in the process of helping the host countries carry out disarmament , restoration , and returning to society .
some peace accords promoted or participated in by the united nations also contain provisions on the protection of children .
national reconciliation is an important condition for lasting peace and stability in the region after the conflict .
after the conflict stops , if the parties concerned cannot bury old grudges and resolve old grievances , then it will be difficult to truly consolidate the peace situation and even the flames of conflict may ignite again .
in many cases , realizing national reconciliation after the conflict requires the joint efforts of all parties concerned , and at the same time , the support and assistance of the international community , especially the united nations .
for many years , the united nations has played a useful role in helping and promoting the process of national reconciliation among countries after the conflict , and has accumulated a lot of experiences . we believe that , on the whole , to successfully help countries to achieve national reconciliation after the conflict , the united nations must properly handle the following three major relationships :
the relationship between short - term needs and long - term objectives should be taken into consideration .
national reconciliation usually takes a certain process and it is very difficult to achieve it overnight .
different stages should have different focuses .
to promote national reconciliation , it is first necessary to let former combat personnel " bid farewell to weapons " and create a safe environment .
at this stage , it is very important to strive to disarm , resume , and return to society the former combat personnel .
we are pleased to see that the situation in bosnia has become increasingly stable , relations between various ethnic groups have been further relaxed , economic reconstruction has yielded initial results , the return of refugees has been basically completed , and relations with neighboring countries have been improving day by day .
the progress made in the peace process in bosnia has not come easily and is gratifying .
we extend our congratulations to the government and people of bosnia - herzegovina and sincerely hope that all parties in bosnia - herzegovina will continue their efforts to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and unceasingly push forward the peace process .
at the same time , we have also noted that the national level of bosnia - herzegovina has yet to be further improved . in particular , reform in the judicial and police sectors is still facing challenges .
we believe that it is appropriate for the high - level deputies to take this as the priority of their work in the first half of this year , and we support the bosnian government in actively cooperating with the high - level representatives .
it is believed that with the help of the international community , the bosnian people will continuously score new achievements in the course of building their own country , take the road of self - determination for development at an early date , and realize the objective of integrating into europe .
the peace and stability in bosnia is of great significance to the realization of lasting peace and development in the region .
the chinese side has always paid close attention to the development of the situation in bosnia - herzegovina and will , together with the international community , continue to make its own contributions to the realization of long - term peace and stability in bosnia - herzegovina and its economic development .
china appreciates the anti-terrorist committee 's efforts to promote the implementation of resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) by various countries , to help developing countries strengthen their anti-terrorism capability , and to support the committee 's efforts to strengthen coordination and cooperation with relevant international , regional and sub - regional organizations in the international anti-terrorism struggle .
at the same time , we hope that the anti - terrorism committee will intensify its efforts to meet the actual needs of developing countries .
at present , the issue of vitalizing the anti - terrorism commission has aroused the concern of many member states .
after repeated consultations , the anti - terrorism committee submitted a formal report and distributed it as a security council document .
after more than two years of practice , the commission 's existing structure and mode of operation have indeed manifested its inadequacy , such as the excessively heavy burden of report by member states , too many meetings and documents , the results of work being awaited , and the lack of coordination among experts .
therefore , we fully support the necessary reforms to the anti - terrorism committee , and we agree with the package of proposals put forward in the report on establishing the anti - terrorism committee executive council , and we hope to resolve these problems as soon as possible , especially the problem of too heavy burdens on the vast numbers of member states .
here , i would like to emphasize that revitalization and reform is a continuous process , that the anti - terrorism committee should maintain policy guidance and guidance for its work , and that all decisions should be made by the plenary session of the anti - terrorism committee .
in recent years , the international community has always paid close attention to the issue of small arms .
this shows that all parties have gradually realized the harm caused to the stability of the regions and countries concerned , the post-war reconstruction , and the social development of the small arms .
fortunately , the united nations has taken a series of effective actions to solve this problem .
in 2001 , the " firearms protocol " attached to the " un convention on cracking down on transnational organized crime " and the " un program of action " for small arms were reached one after another .
this has provided a legal and policy basis for the proper resolution of the issue of small arms , and demonstrated the international community 's determination to crack down on illegal trade of small weapons .
in the past three years , the international community has made great progress in promoting the entry into force of the " firearms protocol " and implementing the " program of action . " in particular , the successful convening of the first annual meeting of the united nations in 2003 on small - scale arms has provided a new driving force for the continued comprehensive and conscientious implementation of the " program of action . "
the resolution 58 / 241 adopted by the un general assembly this year decided to set up a working group to negotiate an international document for the identification and tracking of illegal small arms . this will undoubtedly further promote the international community 's efforts to crack down on the illegal trade of small weapons .
in the same way , the security council has also increasingly attached importance to the issue of small weapons and has conducted special deliberations on many occasions and adopted the chairman 's statement and resolutions .
moreover , in examining a series of issues concerning the protection of civilians , women , and children in the conflicts , the security council has stressed the importance of handling small weapons .
developing the economy and eliminating poverty are the basic premise for achieving sustainable development .
sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and all - round social progress .
if we do not solve the problem of existence , we cannot talk about development , much less sustainable development .
promoting economic development and working to eliminate poverty is the only way for developing countries to move toward sustainable development .
if the poverty problem of developing countries is not solved , it will be difficult for developed countries to sustain their development .
rationally using resources and protecting the environment is an inevitable requirement for achieving sustainable development .
development cannot be carried out at the cost of wasting resources and sacrificing the environment .
natural resources are not inexhaustible , but the demand for the development of human society has continually increased . if these relations are not properly handled , this will inevitably lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment and seriously threaten the survival and development of mankind .
only by following the path of a circular economy based on the most effective use of resources and environmental protection can sustainable development be realized .
achieving comprehensive social progress and improving the people 's living standards and quality is the ultimate goal of sustainable development .
a year ago , the ninth informal meeting of leaders of the asia - pacific economic cooperation was held on the bank of shanghai 's huangpu river . the scenes at that time are still vividly remembered .
today , we are gathering in los cabos , a beautiful scenic spot on the other side of the pacific , to discuss matters of vital importance concerning asia - pacific economic cooperation .
i am very happy to meet my old friend .
i would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to president fox for his kind invitation and the mexican government 's meticulous arrangements .
over the past year , the trend of economic globalization has continued to develop and science and technology are advancing with each passing day , bringing new development opportunities to various countries .
at the same time , uncertainties in global economic development have increased , and some countries and regions , including apec members , are facing new challenges in the course of economic development .
trade protectionism is gaining ground , and realizing freedom , fairness , and justice is still a long - term and arduous task .
the struggle against terrorism is arduous and complicated , and non - traditional security factors have increased .
our world is still far from tranquil .
although the international community is still faced with various problems and may not be so idealistic in the future , the tide of peace and development is irreversible , and the desire of the people of all countries to live a better life has not changed .
it is of great significance that this dialogue meeting is focusing on development .
development is the foundation for the progress of human civilization and is the key to resolving all kinds of contradictions and problems facing the world .
only by achieving global coordination , balance , and universal development can lasting peace and stability be realized in the world .
we should explore this issue comprehensively and thoroughly , and work with concerted efforts to resolve this issue .
accelerated development of the trend of economic globalization has become the most prominent characteristic of the world economy today .
under the impetus of the trend of economic globalization , the contacts between various countries and regions have become closer with each passing day , the market has become more open , and the flow of capital , technology , and talent has become more extensive and rapid . all these have brought about unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and promoting common development .
at the same time , the trend of economic globalization has also brought serious challenges . the gap between the south and the north has widened . some developing countries are facing the danger of being further marginalized . economic and financial risks have increased and transnational crimes are serious . all this has increased the urgency of carrying out international cooperation and meeting challenges together .
at this moment when opportunities and challenges exist side by side , we should seize opportunities , deal with challenges , seek common ground while reserving differences , expand cooperation , and promote economic globalization in the direction of realizing common development and prosperity .

( international ) economists predict us as the biggest winner in depreciation of the us dollar
xinhua news agency , davos , switzerland , january 23 ( reporter li jie and ding xigang ) the 34 th annual meeting of the world economic forum , which is being held in davos , switzerland , conducted a special discussion on the issue of the trend of depreciation of the us dollar on the 23rd . some experts predict that the united states will be the biggest winner in a persistent low exchange rate .
most of the economists attending the meeting believed that us officials , including us treasury secretary john snow , seem to have given up the " strong us dollar policy " they have pursued in recent years .
the falling us dollar will provide the united states with more room for economic development and more employment opportunities , which is clearly reflected in the manufacturing industry .
at the same time , the depreciation of the us dollar has made us products more competitive in domestic and foreign markets , and this will help the united states to fill its trade deficit .
however , experts believe that a weak dollar will also have an adverse impact on the united states .
first , it is possible that the us stock market will continue to decline , the value of various investments will drop , foreign investors will be worried about a further fall in the us dollar , and second , the ever more expensive imports will eventually lead to a decline in the american standard of living , and third , the big depreciation of the us dollar may trigger trade and financial turmoil .
however , the depreciation of the us dollar has caused a more serious blow to europe , japan , and canada .
after the dollar dropped , the pressure on european exports increased , pushing the european economy to the danger of a full - fledged recession .

xinhua news agency , tokyo , january 26 ( reporter : lok shaoyan ) according to statistics released by the japanese finance ministry on the 26th , the volume of import and export trade in japan reached an all - time high in 2003 , and the trade surplus broke through 101,000 - billion yen again three years ago .
on exports , japan 's exports to the united states dropped by 9.8 percent last year , but exports to asia increased by 12.9 percent .
this not only made up for the part of the decline in japan 's exports to the united states , but also enabled japan 's total exports last year to rise by 4.7 percent over the previous year to reach a record 54.59 trillion yen .
in terms of imports , japan 's total import volume in 2003 increased 5% over the previous year , reaching 44.32 trillion yen , also marking a record high , thanks to increases in energy demand and prices .
japan 's trade surplus in 2003 was 10.2387 trillion yen , up 3.6 percent from the previous year , breaking the 10 trillion yen mark again three years ago .

xinhua news agency , guangzhou , january 26 ( chen jianyi ) news from the guangdong provincial industry and commerce bureau that in 2003 , the number of private enterprises in guangdong actually exceeded that of state - owned and their holding enterprises for the first time , and domestic enterprises have been effectively adjusted .
according to statistics , up to the end of 2003 , there were a total of 690,000 enterprises ( including domestic and private enterprises and foreign - invested enterprises ) in the province , an increase of 0.59% over the end of last year .

( international ) the wto has already submitted the dispute over " berlin subsidies " to arbitration
xinhua news agency , geneva , january 26 ( reporter li jie ) the world trade organization announced on the 26th that the appeal of the european union and seven other wto members for sanctions against the united states on the " byrd subsidies " has been submitted to the arbitration body for its ruling .
the united states has failed to scrap the " byrd amendment bill " within the wto deadline .
the " byrd amendment , " which was passed by the us congress in 2000 , demanded that the us government directly subsidize us companies that levy punitive taxes on antidumping and antisubsidy cases , which are damaging , rather than paying them to the us treasury .
this move of the united states has met with opposition from major trading partners , including the european union and japan .
the wto finally concluded in january 2003 that the amendment had violated the global trade rules and asked the united states to repeal it before december 27 .
the united states , however , has not executed the wto decision .
to this end , the european union , japan , canada , brazil , india , south korea , mexico , and chile recently submitted applications to the wto , demanding that the united states be allowed to levy additional tariffs equivalent to the amount of us government subsidies on some of its products .
however , the united states later questioned the extent of the sanctions and the legitimacy of the indictment .
( hong kong , macau , taiwan ) retail business in hong kong rises 10%
xinhua news agency , hong kong , january 28 - according to a disclosure by the hong kong retail management association , retail sales in hong kong during the lunar new year period have been ideal , the business sector has reported an average increase of 10% and 30% in some shopping malls .
yu peng , chairman of the hong kong retail industry management association , said a few days ago that individual tourists visiting hong kong have spurred the atmosphere of consumption in hong kong . during the spring festival this year , retail sales in hong kong were ideal , with increases of 20 to 30 percent in some trades , such as jewellery and clothing . in particular , mainland tourists ' consumption accounted for about 10 percent of the total turnover .
he said that the use of renminbi cards by mainland tourists in hong kong has significantly stimulated the city road of the spring festival , with an average of 3,000 yuan in signing account each time , and the consumption of individual mainland visitors has reached 10,000 yuan .
last year , hong kong suffered from sars , with total retail sales volume falling by 4% .
with the recovery of the economy , hong kong 's overall retail performance will grow at a median rate this year , but there will also be pressure on prices of goods due to increases in costs .
he believed that hong kong 's deflation would improve this year .
( international ) new law on danish immigrants
xinhua news agency , stockholm , january 28 - according to information from copenhagen , the danish government submitted a new bill to parliament on the 28th to limit immigration .
under the act , children of foreign immigrants born in denmark will no longer enjoy the right to automatically obtain denmark 's nationality .
the bill was the latest move by danish liberal party leader lasen in a series of restrictive immigration measures since he took office in november 2001 .
it is reported that the bill may be passed by the parliament because the liberal party has won the support of the right - wing danish people 's party on the immigration issue .
under the bill , children of foreign nationals born in denmark are required to apply for nationality , not automatically nationality , as in the case of other immigrants .
those who have obtained nationality will be deprived of their nationality if they have committed the crime of having committed serious harm to society .
in the past two years , the danish government has put forward a series of measures to restrict the flow of long - term residents and restrict the entry of migrants to denmark .
the number of foreign asylum seekers in denmark dropped from 1,4347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 , as the danish government adopted an unwelcome attitude on immigration .
the country 's image as a free country and a country of human rights which denmark has always flaunted has also been damaged .
in less than one month after the spring festival , three extraordinarily serious safety incidents have occurred in china , with dozens killed each time .
people are amazed at the high accident rate and the serious loss of life .
in the past few months , several hundred people have been killed in a gas pipeline accident in chongqing , a gas explosion at several coal mines , and a frequent fatal traffic accident .
china is a vast country with a dense population , and the probability of a disaster is greater than that of other countries . if things are not moved , it will lead to the death of several dozen or even hundreds of people . this is a reality that there is nothing to do .
however , judging from the general knowledge , the accident in china is still too frequent .
among the numerous disasters , there were more fires , coal mine explosions , firecrackers explosions , and passenger traffic accidents .
at least , this illustrates two issues : one is the worst safety measures in these areas , and the other is that people have not learned lessons from past tragedies so that similar accidents can be repeated .
in the past when singapore 's economy grew at a high speed , there was also a serious fire in which the painful memory of the fire remains deep , but it also rapidly raised singapore 's awareness of security and prevention in public places .
china is also in a very rapid economic growth and social restructuring period .
although the figure is not too high in proportion , the number of accidents involving foreign domestic helpers ' falling into a building is far from meeting the nature of work in a relatively safe working environment of their domestic helpers .
from january 1999 to june 2003 , a total of 99 maids of various nationalities were killed in the accident .
behind these figures are fratricide families that are one after another unable to return home to their daughters and mothers . one thing we should be able to avoid misfortune is also the direction we must do our best to lower the regretful figure to the minimum .
according to a recent statement by the indonesian embassy , since 1999 96 indonesian maids have been killed while working in singapore , some of whom have died while working in high buildings .
the indonesian government has from time to time expressed dissatisfaction over the work of maids and has formulated new regulations on a number of occasions to more strictly control the quality of domestic helpers and to protect the safety of maids , but problems have not been resolved .
what is puzzling is that , compared to the casualty figures on construction sites and the number of maids accidentally falling onto the building , it is even more necessary for people to ponder deeply .
chen kongli , renowned taiwan issue expert in mainland china and abroad , recently published a new book entitled " observe taiwan . "
most articles in the book are written into the first change of political parties in taiwan in march 2000 . up to chen shui - bian 's " one country on each side " theory , it was the author 's observation and reflection of taiwan 's internal situation and cross - strait relations during the period of " judging him by his deeds , not just by his words . "
the articles written two years ago have been published only two years ago . this shows that the mainland has had a very complicated link in examining taiwan - related research papers , and the process is long . it shows that " observing taiwan " has not come easily .
for a long time , while observing and studying the taiwan issue , chen kongli has been seeking truth and dealing with issues in a practical and realistic manner , has not been restricted by any subjective political framework , and has made efforts to explore the profound and penetrating insight of the countless eras .
after reading this book , this characteristic impressed people more deeply .
in the early 1980s of the last century , the taiwan issue became a " theoretical study " on the mainland , with various kinds of research institutions appearing one after another and various categories of scholars and experts emerging in succession .
overseas , people generally divided taiwan research institutions on the mainland into northern and southern branches .
the stance of the north faction is quite close to that of the government , and their speeches are rather hardline . in the course of development of certain specific historical or major political events , they are more overbearing hawks .
the institute of taiwan studies in the south china sea is mainly distributed in areas south of the chang jiang , including shanghai and fujian .
the " academic qualification " of junichiro koizumi who " studied in london for two years " was exposed by japanese media as a matter of fact .
the nihon keizai shimbun confirmed to the office of the london university that koizumi had only attended only a few doors during the nine months in britain and did not get any degree either .
the scandal has been reported or reprinted by big and small media in china , which has made the broad masses of compatriots happy .
indeed , a japanese prime minister in a dignified false academic credentials to deceive the local people .
especially in japan where " imperialism " exists , it is even more shameful .
however , if we can change our point of view , perhaps from this scandal we can also see some positive significance .
moreover , these positive things are precisely what we lack , and are also things that we must perfect .
in recent years , we have always advocated " honesty , " tried to " create a sunlight government , " respected the public 's " right to know , " and wanted to make administrative " transparent , " but facts are still far from ideal .
if you think , it is not that big matter , but it can be exposed by the media and is hotly pursued and fiercely attacked by the prime minister .
in such a country , what else can there be no " sunshine " ?
at taiwan 's election campaign , all major camps will mobilize the tour cars to send the masses to the venue . however , the recent situation is that the evening party and chen shui - bian and annette lu are more cold - shouldered by lien chan and james soong .
not long ago , when taiwan president chen shui - bian went to a certain place in the northern part of the country to clamor for " frozen garlic ( winning the election ) , " half of the people in taiwan still did not want to lose face .
if there is no accident , when the countdown begins for taiwan 's presidential election , judging from public opinion polls to the underground tip - off , it should be possible to assume that chen lu will lose .
in the past four years , chen shui - bian has proven that he has no way of winning the hearts of the people , but has instead made the green camp 's various " black gold " and " low taste " performances and that he has been instrumental in presenting the confidence of the people .
how should beijing view the pan - blue forces , which might have become the ruling party again ?
first of all , we should understand that the pan - blue army , which might hold power again , is no longer simply a kmt - i - party that is strong , but a meeting with oranges as well as whether its internal traditions are compatible with the nativistic faction .
close cooperation during the election period should not be regarded as an inevitable relationship in the future .
if there is hope of winning the election , it is certain that it will take time to carry out an internal realignment . the upcoming yearend election of the legislative yuan will also make it very difficult for the lien - soong regime to make a big change in cross - strait relations .
unless the united states is aware that the improvement of cross - strait relations can give a greater share of taiwan 's internal politics and is certain to make achievements within a short time , the most important thing is to let the people feel the result .
because of this background , beijing should temporarily postpone the movement of promoting reunification and consolidate the internal situation of lien chan and soong , as leaders of the " traditional blue camp . "
it has been more than half a century since the united states conducted its first nuclear explosion in new mexico in july 1945 and dropped two atomic bombs on japan in august of the same year .
although the arms race between the united states and the soviet union have caused nuclear weapons to stockpile on the stage that can destroy the entire world , fortunately both sides have realized the danger of a nuclear war and avoided pushing the button .
after the soviet union disintegrated and the world entered the post - cold war era , the danger of a large - scale nuclear war has basically been eliminated .
but at the same time , the danger of nuclear proliferation has increased rather than reduced .
this phenomenon of proliferation finds expression in two aspects .
first , out of the aims of regional hegemony , confrontation with neighboring countries , safeguarding security , or pursuing blackmail diplomacy , certain medium - sized countries with considerable resources and strength are striving to produce and possess nuclear weapons through various means .
the other is a group organization of non - countries , especially an islamic extremist force that has a strong hatred against the western world , and is also doing everything possible to seek small nuclear weapons , not hesitating to harm a large number of innocent people to engage in bloody terrorist activities against the west .
under such demand , intermediaries and " nuclear black market " engaging in nuclear weapons , technology transfer , and trade have emerged as the times require , and their scale has expanded daily , becoming an important component of current world nuclear proliferation .
as a descendant of the chinese nation who grew up in the hangzhou lake area , the rural scene in the southern part of the chang jiang and the impression of the peasants ' life still remain in my memory .
i returned to my hometown after a few years ' time , and found that those who were walking along the shanghai - hangzhou expressway were attached to the three - story house built by the peasants everywhere , but very few saw people living there .
this is really astonishing to me , and it is hard to believe that there will be such a big change in our fellow citizens , who still have deep affection for their relatives in other countries .
recently , however , i could not help feeling surprised and shocked when i saw on the internet some reports , literature , and scholars , about china 's rural situation .
unexpectedly , there still exists such an unimaginable dark side in china 's rural areas , and chinese peasants are still living in such an humiliating and arduous life .
after conducting an on - the - spot interview in rural areas of anhui , henan , and hebei , chen guidi and his wife delivered a long report on " investigation in china 's rural areas , " which produced a shock to chinese society .
from the numerous facts of the peasants being corrupted by corrupt officials and even the innocent killed , they have come to such a conclusion : " when we approach chinese peasants , we feel unprecedentedly shocking and dizzy . we can see the poverty you have imagined , an unimaginable sinkable evil , an unimaginable struggle , an unimaginable and sorrowful feeling . "
this is indeed an expression of feeling and tears .
beyond expectation , malaysian prime minister abdullah abala announced the dissolution of parliament the day before yesterday , and the new general election will be held in the near future .
the election will be a major event in his political career , and the results of the election are also symbolic to malaysia 's political situation and development trends .
adula took over the leadership from mahathir in november last year , but it has been only four months since then .
in spite of this , he still decided to dissolve the congress and advance the general election .
this at least includes two meanings : first , adallah is satisfied with his performance in four months and full of confidence in his voters ' intent . second , he hopes to consolidate his power base so as to get himself out of the shadow of mahathir .
undoubtedly , the decision made by addulah to hold a lightning election shows that he has made a comprehensive evaluation of the domestic political situation .
the current economic situation in macedonia is good , and there is no question of being grabbed or used by the opposition parties .
in addition , addulah has adopted some relatively high - visibility measures to fight corruption since taking office , including arresting and prosecuting former minister of land and cooperation katsada [ name as transliterated ] , etc. , all of which has won a certain degree of praise and the public is optimistic about future anticorruption actions .
at the same time , he called for greater efficiency in civil service , which is also a very encouraging move .
since its birth , the growth and shaping of eu has been strongly influenced by french politics and culture .
in terms of diplomacy for independence and self - determination , the attitude and way of handling world affairs differ from that of the united states . this is the orientation of eu 's foreign policy and can clearly see the shadow of france .
it is precisely for this reason that the international community , including china , russia , and arab countries , hopes to see the rise of the eu and see a force of complete independence in international exchanges .
it must be acknowledged that since the late 1980 's , the eu has indeed worked hard in this direction in foreign affairs .
in december 1992 , the heads of eu countries unanimously agreed at the maastricht summit that all member states would pursue a unified foreign policy in order to use the same standards to speak to foreign countries .
however , two years later , when dealing with the issue of bosnia - herzegovina , the so - called " united foreign policy " was thoroughly defeated for the first time .
from the maastricht summit until today , it can be said that eu diplomacy , which has lasted for as long as 10 years , has been weak and sound .
in particular , the eu 's foreign policy cannot stand the test of major events .
the different standpoints adopted by each member country in the us - iraq war not only proved this point , but also again fully exposed the fatal political flaw of the eu . that is , it is very easy for the eu to be cured by other big powers and be broken by each other .
on 24 february , president bush announced in the white house that he would support the constitutional amendment to ban marriage of the same nature .
this marked a notable change in his ambiguous attitude over the last few months on this issue , representing an important development in us politics during the election year .
this constitutional amendment , which forbids marriage of the same nature , is a very powerful political weapon in the southern part of the republican party . however , it also has a very negative effect , that is , in the whole country of the united states , this is a heavy weight in cultural controversy aimed at splitting public opinion , which will undoubtedly intensify the polarization of us politics and further widen the east and west of the liberal .
as far as bush himself , who repeatedly claimed that he was a " member of the communist party " and not a " divider , " is obviously saying one thing but doing another .
in addition , the stance of the younger generation in the united states on the issue of homosexuality has become increasingly open . although this move by bush has short - term results , it will damage the republican party 's long - term interests .
bush 's new " constitutional amendment " offensive can be termed as the " scorched - earth strategy " for the presidential election this year .
bush has adopted this strategy because he has become increasingly weak in the " anti-terrorism " war and the economy - - the key issue of employment , and has no choice but to open up a new battlefield on the religious and cultural agenda aimed at splitting domestic public opinion .
the us attitude so far remains cautious .
that is to say , maintaining the status quo in the taiwan strait can satisfy the long - term us goal of containing the mainland strategically , the united states must avoid political and military conflicts with china due to its encouragement of taiwan independence .
it can be imagined that the united states will not completely remove the room for holding a referendum on taiwan in accordance with beijing 's demand , but out of consideration for its own interests , it will also take some early warning actions .
recently , us secretary of state powell reiterated his taiwan policy on his own initiative and expressed the us stand against taiwan independence .
this statement has been interpreted by outsiders as an aim to curb and prevent chen shui - bian from being possessed by the devil .
some us think tank figures with official background recently made some remarks and the united states will soon dispatch a large number of spy ships to the taiwan strait to detect military developments . all this indirectly proves that the united states is very concerned about the situation in the taiwan strait .
it shows from another angle that although the united states will not completely stop taiwan from holding a referendum according to beijing 's demands , it is equally worried about the uncertainty in the taiwan strait situation during this period .
in the end , there can only be a result of any large - scale and one - way election . either chen shui - bian can get the chance to rejoin , or lien chan can reenter the taiwan presidential office .
what is worrying is that under the condition of unsymmetrical information dissemination , people from all walks of life on the mainland seem to have not been psychologically prepared for chen shui - bian 's possible victory .
if the election result is not the intention , then beijing will again fall into an unnecessary passive situation .
an arab forehead said : " the confusion of one day is more frightening than a thousand years . "
is this worrying about the countries of northeast asia at present ?
i think the answer is generally affirmative .
a well - known research and development center close to washington and funded by the us government has explored in a recent study the four policy options for dealing with the korean nuclear crisis , namely , exchanges and encirclement , economic sanctions , and preemptive strikes .
the attitude of regional countries towards these strategies is the focus of the survey .
in addition , the survey also analyzed the threat posed by north korea 's nuclear weapons program based on the possibility and damage to nuclear weapons by the people of its neighboring countries and their fears .
china and russia feel that the danger of north korea 's use of nuclear weapons is low or very low , while the japanese and south korean people think that the threat is quite serious .
all northeast asian countries agreed to maintain contacts with the dprk .
japan supports its containment . other countries also believe that under certain circumstances , the containment strategy is acceptable .
singapore is very concerned about its international ranking , and at the end of a year is watching closely the list of various countries unveiled by eu and us institutions .
the constant ranking is of course also increasing our attention to the ranking .
however , the first worry is quite a lot .
in general , the countrymen feel that they are too careful to lose and that their rankings are very proud .
people say we should live in a healthier environment and be better able to compete with the world .
because many people were disgusted with the ranking in the past , a wonderful phenomenon emerged : people no longer seem to regard " world first " as good news , but more inclined to regard this as an embarrassing matter .
however , the situation has changed in the past two years .
we are skeptical of the country 's long - term competitiveness , and people in all trades and professions are also worried about their own difficulties in running their businesses .
with such doubts , we will no longer talk about casual matters .
international competition is fierce , and excessive drift may lead to others ' catching up , and the best of all is that they can easily become typical .
on the surface , bush was quite polite about cheney . at the republican convention at the end of last month , bush still pledged in all sincerity and seriousness that cheney is the vice president 's candidate .
however , he also jokingly said that as in the year 2000 , he had appointed cheney as the vice presidential candidate .
cheney , who has always kept a low profile , has recently frequently appeared in public and denied being replaced .
however , he left a lower level for himself .
he said that if he had a problem of health or felt that he had really become a president 's burden , he would have difficulty retreating .
cheney was 63 and had a record of heart sickness four times .
recently , it was widely rumored that the us military actually surrounded 9.11 terrorist group , just like the moment when the time was ripe , just like attacking a turtle in a jar .
in the presidential election on 2 november , it is said that the pentagon has arranged to put on a good show of alive in okada in october .
however , night long dreamt , if , in case o ma , had leaked the fish , there would be endless troubles .
it seems that julius is a trump card for bush to win votes in a bid to win votes .
opposition to the us presidential election in 2004 has been decided : democratic candidate kerry challenges republican president bush .
they began their " warm - up activities " such as advertising and campaigning before the november general election .
they will probably sidestep the three major topics of war , economy , and society and engage in verbal exchange .
bush believes that war is close to us national security and that sending troops to overthrow saddam and counter - terrorism is to ensure us security , so he keeps telling the people that " we are in war . "
kerry naturally would point out that bush 's erroneous intelligence that abused iraq 's weapons of mass destruction to launch the iraq war was not true .
speaking of the economy , kerry believed that bush 's tax cut plan would benefit the rich and could not create new employment opportunities .
" asked kerry to see , " is n't the current us economic data the upper hand ?
with regard to social issues , with regard to relations between men and women , bush opposes marriage of the same nature , opposes abortion , and opposes death penalty .
how bush and kerry will have their own views on these three major issues and , through advertisements , television , and speeches , convince the voters . this is the political show that they will perform in the next eight months .
however , on a diplomatic issue , there is plenty of room for maneuver .
according to information , young people aged between 15 and 19 who choose to commit suicide are mostly youngsters aged 10 to 14 .
it is generally considered that academic pressure is the cause of the suicidal suicide of children and youngsters , but the study found that , in particular , love between men and women and their parents , were the main cause of helping local youths to find out their own problems .
the academic pressure and expectation of fall naturally fall within the realm of communication between parents and children .
the pressure for further studies is an unavoidable burden for local students for a long time , and the pressure is sometimes given by themselves , and sometimes it is because parents plus children .
if parents demand that their children score good results and take other children into consideration in order to go upstream , it will certainly put a lot of pressure on them . however , the channel of persuasion and communication behind the pressure is the gentle method for assessing family - child relations .
if the children 's performance is not ideal , parents use either criticism or slander , and even make the children feel that they are disappointing , undoubtedly pushing the children to the hopeless situation of seeking help .
it is understood that many young students who need counselling are being forced into the dead end by their parents ' excessively high expectations .
singapore 's success and rapid development have made parents feel that the material conditions of children are much better than they used to be . it is unavoidable that they think children should perform better than they themselves .
generally , when parents forget that they are still children , actually their performances in various aspects may not be particularly outstanding .
by one and a half years , the overwhelming majority of children were sent to the nursery of various units to implement a full system , and the authorities just collect a bit of orthodox fees , and the children only came home a week or even a month .
today , singapore is facing a social problem of a declining fertility rate and an aging population .
in order to maintain modern living standards and seasonal substances , the younger generation is unable to fend for themselves , and they are still devoted to responding to the government 's call for early marriage .
this author has a bold suggestion : the government should take over new children .
the people of our country only control their lives and do not need to worry about breeding problems .
on the one hand , the government has opened a wholly - owned nursery , changed primary schools to full - time , or even offered three meals services , and symbolically charged citizens ' fees .
this can not only solve the employment problem of the unemployed population but also reduce their brains not to be effective in taking such measures as infants ' bonuses , increasing maternity leave , women 's quality , and tax rebate .
what beijing needs to do is not only playing the leading role of the six - party talks but also taking into consideration china 's long - term interests on the korean peninsula , taking precautions beforehand , and starting strategic deployment as early as possible .
to put it in concrete terms , beijing wants to urge the dprk to give up its nuclear arms . on the other hand , it has proceeded from the transformation of kim chong - il 's regime to take the road of modern civilization , relieve the danger of the nuclear war in northeast asia , and maintain the status quo of the korean peninsula , thus gaining a bargaining chip in launching a long - term strategic deal with the united states .
being ferocious in appearance but feeble in essence , pyongyang is very eager to develop the economy and integrate into the international community .
however , such a wish is often expressed in an outer form by force , irrationality , or even totally not conforming to international rules .
in fact , for some time in the past , beijing has already taken advantage of its influence and economic aid to force pyongyang to change its stand that does not accord with international rules .
however , this action still needs comprehensive planning .
beijing 's aid to pyongyang should not be confined to the economic level but should also be extended to other areas of society , and should not be limited to pyongyang 's abandonment of its nuclear program , but should all the more focus on onto the path of modern civilization .
when kerry started to enter the competition , nobody was optimistic about him . at that time all the focal points were in the hands of former governor of vermont .
however , before the meeting of the group in iowa in january , the troops of texas scored one victory after another and won the party - caucus and preliminary elections in the state of iowa and new hampshire .
in the following state primaries , kerry basically had not lost his hand , and the lost states were all because the state had its own candidate to run in the election .
it took kerry only six weeks to become the last candidate from a candidate with almost no future . his competitors , including gephardt , lieberman , clarke , dian , and edwards , fell one after another . this can not but make people look at kerry 's political charm with admiration .
during his 19 - year senator career , kerry had always supported abortion and environmental protection policies , opposed tax reduction schemes that would benefit the rich , worked hard to raise minimum salaries , and hoped to resolve the global warming problem .
his work experience in washington has demonstrated his courage to face up to difficult social problems , to challenge authority , and to pursue value and not to offend the interests of a small number of people .
china 's policy of reform and opening up started from agriculture and rural residents were the earliest to benefit from this policy .
however , since the 1990 's , since economic policies were leaning heavily toward cities , agricultural reform has basically stagnated , and the gap between urban and rural areas has become increasingly wide .
after a long time , china has seen two utterly different worlds . one is a highly prosperous city , and the other is a poor and backward countryside .
in chinese officials ' words , the widening gap between urban and rural areas is a " problem of development , " so it still needs to be resolved through sustained development .
in other words , china 's coastal areas and cities should continue to develop and should not be affected by rural problems .
however , when we see some big cities change every year and change every three years , we cannot but ask : why have n't some poor areas changed much in the past several decades ?
of course , the development channels of urban and rural areas are very different . this is a fact that we should recognize . but the question is : when we invest a large amount of funds in urban construction and encourage and support the prosperous middle class , will we be concerned about and attach importance to the 70% of the rural population in the whole country ?
theoretically , all previous chinese governments have paid no attention to agricultural , rural , and peasant issues .
in recent years , however , the rural situation has become increasingly difficult and worse , and this shows that the emphasis has become increasingly insufficient .
in any country , the public security , procuratorial , and law should be the symbol of justice and justice and the most important system for ensuring social stability .
but unfortunately , the public security , procuratorial , and law have become the symbol of corruption in china .
according to a recent national audit report , the results of last year 's examination of the financial expenditure of public security organs in 26 provinces and municipalities indicated that the amount of public security funds in violation of regulations reached 16.5 billion yuan .
the confidence crisis in public security , procuratorial , and law has become open .
the liu yong incident , sun zhigang incident , and the recent " bmw " incident in heilongjiang all reflected this profound distrust .
the " bmw " incident is even more typical .
people 's concern for this issue has even far exceeded their concern for sars during the period of sars .
in fact , people 's concern is no longer the " bmw " incident itself , but rather a show of distrust for the entire judicial system .
the departments concerned are very clear about this , so they have taken a ban on the media soon .
but the question is still there .
the second round of six - party talks on the korean peninsula nuclear issue concluded in a widely expected result .
during the talks , the parties concerned carried out contacts and probes over the peripheral issues of the nuclear crisis on the peninsula and reached consensus on the third round of talks and the establishment of a working group before the end of june this year .
however , on such substantive issues as how north korea should abandon its nuclear weapons development program and how the united states should ensure political and military security in north korea and provide energy aid to north korea , the talks not only made no progress , but also gave people the feeling that the " blind end " is getting closer and closer .
both the dprk and the united states have not made any concessions . neither side has softened its basic stance .
however , what attracted people 's attention was that during the talks , the united states showed an attitude of not being eager to resolve problems and gave people the impression of " delaying . "
this tactic expressed by the united states is closely related to the current new developments in the international situation and the benefits it will gain in these new developments .
since roosevelt became president , many american corporate bosses have never been behind bars .
this is a coincidence or the public and investors have been putting up with the end of their forbearance in committing corporate crimes and other illegal acts in the past three years , so they have been exposed one after another recently .
the answer may not be simple , but it is a fact that many companies have been exposed recently .
this is a good sign of economic recovery , especially the recovery of investment confidence .
the late 1990s may be one of the most chaotic and most difficult stages in us business history . the sooner the impact disappeared , the better .
after the dust settled , the names of some companies will inevitably dim into history and will only be found in commercial college textbooks .
in addition , under the leadership of the new management team , some companies such as taike and ci will try hard to reorganize to usher in a new round of economic growth .
when will the new round of economic growth come ?
as a member of the wto , you may have no answer .
it is not necessary to do so because us federal reserve chairman greenspan does not know the answer either .
the bush administration wants to stimulate the economy by means of keynism , which on the one hand vigorously increases expenditure ( especially defense spending ) , and on the other hand is a big tax cut .
internationally , the bush administration continues to promote free trade , but the trade deficit has reached a record high of $ 549 billion .
after a big tax cut , investment and consumption did not increase significantly .
the new kaiers , represented by famous british economist michael delley ( yme godley ) , believes that the us economy is in a difficult position and bush 's financial strategy has no magic to heaven .
they believe that the so - called " commanding the market rules " is nothing but an illusion which will inevitably lead to a small number of people benefiting and most of them suffer .
people used to think that the so - called small number of people who made profits on a global scale are in the united states , and the majority of those who suffered losses are in developing countries .
now , facts are different .
many people in the us economic circles believe that apart from multinational companies based on the united states , india and china are also at a prominent position .
india has occupied the service economy domain and china has occupied the manufacturing sector .
people are concentrating their energy on the phenomenon of the massive transfer of us capital and equipment to china , but they do not see the advantage of china 's high - level , low - income labor market .
first , taiwan 's current situation is estimated in beijing and is still outside beijing 's estimation .
how does beijing assess that it only knows about its own , but the result can be pondered from the open phenomenon ?
over the past four years , the camps of chen shui - bian and annette lu have made clear - cut words , worked industriously , and the taiwan independence movement has made positive progress .
on the other hand , beijing has a similar attitude towards taiwan independence .
however , since the fall of last year , it seems that the bull car has changed into a car . it is obvious that in the last few months , its handling capacity is vastly different from that of the 1990 's .
based on this , we can conclude that taiwan 's current situation is within its estimation .
second , let 's look at taiwan - related diplomacy .
with regard to the development of the situation in the taiwan strait , we should see whether the attitude of the united states and other major countries is relatively close to beijing or is relatively close to taipei .
the answer is clear because the attitudes of various countries are open .
so far , not only have the countries and beijing become closer and more specific , they have changed rather far from taipei and have less specific exchanges in this regard , but they have also begun to give the taiwan democracy which has always been praised by the authorities .
